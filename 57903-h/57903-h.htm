<p class='c010'>“Well, boys, though I am your uncle, so busy
has my life been, that I have seen but very little
of you. During my present visit we shall become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>better acquainted with each other. You want to
hear about soldiers and sailors. You have seen
privates on parade, a recruiting sergeant with
stripes on his arm, and an officer with epaulettes
on his shoulder. You have seen, too, a jolly
Jack-tar just come home from a cruise, rigged
out in his holiday clothes, check shirt, blue jacket,
and white trousers. You have read, perhaps, a
little about engagements and sea-fights, and remember
the names of a few famous generals and
admirals, and now you want to hear more about
soldiers and sailors. You shall know all that I
can tell you; but, mind! let us have no confusion.
Do not all of you ask me questions at once!
Speak one at a time, or, if you like it better, let
one of you be spokesman for the rest. You shall
have all the information that I can give you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you!—thank you, uncle! That will be
the very thing; for we know that you can tell us a
great deal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am, as you know, neither commander-in-chief
of the army, nor lord high admiral of the
navy, nor do I see any likelihood at present of my
being appointed either the one or the other; but
having seen a good deal of the land and sea-service,
and noticed the habits and conduct of men, from
the raw recruit to the general officer;—from the
sailor before the mast to the ‘Red Flag at the
Fore,’—I must have been dull indeed to have picked
up nothing. It becomes no man to be vain of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>his knowledge, and, therefore, I will not boast of
mine; but ask me what you will, and I will answer
to the best of my ability.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please to tell us which are the bravest men,
soldiers or sailors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The bravest! That is a puzzling question,
which the seven wise men of Greece, were they
here, could not answer. Never yet did a red-coat
go where a blue-jacket was afraid to follow, nor a
son of Neptune brave a danger that a son of Mars
would not, willingly, have faced before him. Weigh
one golden sovereign against another in a pair of
scales, and they will not give a more even balance
than the bravery of a soldier weighed against that
of a sailor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many kinds of soldiers are there?—for
some are very different to others.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, let me see, in the cavalry there are life-guards,
horse-guards, dragoon-guards, heavy dragoons,
light dragoons, lancers and hussars; and
in the infantry there are foot-guards, infantry of
the line, light troops, fusiliers, highlanders, riflemen,
and the staff-corps. I have said nothing of
the engineers and artillery, nor indeed of the marines,
who have more to do with the navy than the
army.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They say that one Englishman can beat ten
Frenchmen. Is it true?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a word of truth in it. A brave man is a
match for a brave man of the same size all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>world over, if he have equal skill. It is skill more
than strength that enables one man to overcome
another, and tactics more than bravery, (though
both are necessary,) that enable an army or a fleet
to obtain a victory. I will try to make this clear
to you before I have done.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now do tell us, uncle, all about soldiers and
sailors, from the beginning to the end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would take me a month to do. I mean
to give you anecdotes in abundance about military
and naval commanders, that you may see the advantage
of knowledge and skill; at the same time
I will try to mingle with them many details that
will be interesting to you, of the navy and the
army.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! That will be a good plan. Now for a
little about soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I were giving you my own history, I might
be tempted to dwell on my own exploits, but as
that is not the case I shall try to keep close to my
subject,—Soldiers and Sailors. When a recruit is
enlisted and sworn in before a magistrate he is
put into the awkward squad for a time, and then
he enters the ranks. He has much to learn before
he becomes a thorough soldier, from standing at
ease to the charge; from the single file to the battle
array.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The sergeant must have something to do with
the recruits that come from the plough-tail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed he has, but he very soon effects a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>change in their appearance. The first thing the
recruit has to learn is to stand in a proper position.
Then come facing, stepping, and marching,
filing, wheeling, and with the manual and platoon
exercise, forming; and, if in the cavalry, saddling,
bridling, mounting, riding, and leaping, with the
manœuvres of troops and squadrons, companies,
battalions and regiments. What with carbine and
pistol exercise, sword exercise and lance exercise,
with parade, mounting guard, and keeping accoutrements,
and perhaps, a horse in order, a soldier
has many duties to perform.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And have sailors as much to do as soldiers?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, that they have, and every change of
wind brings them a change of duty. For some
time I was in the marines, and saw a good deal of
the wooden walls of old England. Officers, seamen,
ordinary men, servants and boys, were all
alive from stem to stern; from keel to sky-scrapers
all things were in order. There were no
skulkers among the blue-jackets. Everything was
attended to; the decks were swabbed, the anchor
weighed, the yards manned, the sails reefed, and
the decks cleared for action.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sailors seem to work hard and play hard then,
for no people enjoy themselves more when they
are away from their ship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True. They work hard, play hard, and
fight hard; but, say what you will, it is not all
sunshine with soldiers and sailors. A soldier, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>parade or on a review day, looks like a man of
leisure, and in time of peace he is not overdone
with his duty; but see him in war, marching
through miry roads, panting with heat or numbed
with cold, up early and late, sleeping on the bare
ground in his wet clothes:—hunger pinches him,
fatigue wears him, and the stormy fight with all
its dangers awaits him,—yet, on he goes without a
murmur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neither does honest Jack lead a life of ease,
or sleep upon roses. See him in the north, when
the rigging of his ship is hung with icicles; in
the east and west, when the deck is almost as
hot as a baker’s oven; holding his weary midnight
watch in the calm, and reefing the fluttering sail
in the storm.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Jack never despairs—see, his bosom ne’er quivers</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Though hurricanes cause every timber to start;</div>
      <div class='line'>The tempest may rend a proud vessel to shivers,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But nothing can conquer a firm British heart.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Waves may dash and lightnings flash, but
Jack flinches not from his duty. Aloft, below, at
the mast-head or in the cockpit, he endures dangers
and pain, and stands by his gun in the roar of
the battle!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A great deal may be said about soldiers and
sailors?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,—and they have generally a great deal
to say about themselves: the one fighting his battles
over again, and the other spinning his yarns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>about cruises and privateering, and cutting out
ships, and the winds blowing great guns in the
Bay of Biscay. Soldiers are soldiers everywhere,
and sailors keep up their character for courage,
whether on the sea or in harbour, in a storm or a
calm, in a battle or a breeze.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was it that made you list for a soldier?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A thoughtless prank, my lads. In my youthful
days I was fond of reading of knights armed cap-à-piè,
mounted on fiery steeds,—lance in the rest,
helmet on the head, vambrace on the arm, cuirass
on the breast, cuisses on the thighs, greaves on the
legs, and sabatynes on the feet. I loved to read,
too, of ancient arms, clubs and slings, bows and
arrows, swords, falchions, javelins, maces, battle-axes
and battering-rams; and the portable arms
when gunpowder came into use,—hand-gun, arquebus,
haquebut, wheel-lock, caliver, petronel, dag,
dragon and hand-mortar;—and these things led
me on to a soldier’s life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, ay! Like us, you wanted to know
everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very true. My curiosity was excited, and I
wished to hear all I could about modern arms,
from the poniard to the pike, from the cutlass
to the carbine, from the hand-grenade to the
Congreve rocket, from the six-pounder to the big
brass cannon at Bejapoor in Hindoostan, and
from the horse-pistol in the houlster of a dragoon to
the monster mortar used at the siege of Antwerp.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“And we wish to hear all about these things,
too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was another circumstance, too, that
did much towards leading me into the army. I
chanced to form an acquaintance with an old soldier
who knew everything about fortification, engineering,
and gunnery. He had had his share of sieges
and storming-parties, and seemed as familiar
with trenches, ditches, fascines and scaling-ladders,
as a schoolboy is with his peg-top and his
kite. He used to describe to me the whole affair,
from first breaking ground to the taking of a garrison,
the glacis, scarps, and counter-scarps, ramparts,
lunettes, bastions, batteries and citadel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No wonder that you should listen to a man
like him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was, indeed, wondrously interesting, and
we talked together by the hour of Soldiers and
Sailors. ‘Forward,’ and ‘Off she goes,’ were
our mottoes. We advanced in double quick time
with the red-coats, and only halted in a case of
necessity. We shared the birth of honest Jack
when buffeted on the billows, nor left him till he
put into harbour, mingled his prize-money with
his pig-tail tobacco, and sang ‘Britannia rules
the waves.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did the old soldier describe a battle to you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did, and many of them, too. The plan of
an engagement was unknown to me, and I had
formed strange notions of one army attacking another.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>He explained to me the movements of the
advanced guard, the main body, the wings, the reserve,
and the artillery; and discoursed freely of
sentinels, vedettes, patrols, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquets</span>, and the general
arrangements of an army in the field.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He would be quite at home there!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such conversation as this led me to read of
celebrated military and naval commanders, with
the battles they had fought, and the victories they
had won. Of Frederick the Great, of Prussia;
Charles of Sweden; Peter the Great, of Russia;
Buonaparte of France; and Marlborough and
Wellington of England; with Hawkins, Drake,
Frobisher, Rodney, Howe, Duncan and Nelson.
At that time I knew nothing, or next to nothing,
of a sea-fight, of the order of battle, of ships taking
their stations, of signals, and the several duties of
officers and men during the action; and of broadsides,
raking, and boarding; but since then I have
picked up some information on most of these
points.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That old soldier must have known a great
deal!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did know a great deal, for he had mingled
among sailors as well as soldiers, so that he could
talk freely of actions, attacks, and attempts, battles,
blockades, and bombardments, descents and
defeats, engagements and expeditions, invasions,
reductions, sea-fights and storms, sieges, surprises,
skirmishes, repulses, and explosions.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“We do not wonder at your having entered
the army, but a battle must be a terrible thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is true, sure enough. It is one thing
to hear or to read of a battle, and another to fight
in the ranks. War is no child’s play, as every
one knows who has seen service. There are different
opinions about war: one man sees in it
nothing but what is honourable and glorious;
another maintains that it is in no case to be justified.
It is not for me to decide between the two,
seeing that I agree with neither, for while on the
one hand I hold it wrong to plunge into war on
light grounds when it can be avoided, or when it
inflicts a greater evil than it undertakes to remove;
on the other, I cannot see how war can
be always evaded. If to oppress others be wrong,
to allow ourselves to be oppressed can hardly be
right; and though conquest and national glory will
not justify those who draw the sword, yet, as a
nation, we must be other than we are before we
could give up what is dearer than life without an
effort to defend it. However, my object is not
to turn your heads with false notions of honour
and glory, that you may long to become Wellingtons
and Nelsons, but simply to give, according
to your desire, what information I can about soldiers
and sailors, and to explain to you the way
in which they carry on war.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, those are the very things! We want to
know everything about them. We saw a sailor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>yesterday; and the road seemed hardly broad
enough for him, he reeled about so much from
one side to the other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jack-tars too often fall into this error; they
are too often <i>half-seas-over</i> before they are out of
<i>port</i>, and they are usually the most <i>steady</i> when
being <i>tossed about</i> on the ocean.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That sounds comical, however.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps it does, but I wish to be pointed in
my remarks, that there may be some likelihood of
your remembering what I say. The army, from
the commander-in-chief to the men in the ranks,
should aim at respectability. A <i>general</i> should
never be without a good <i>private</i> character, and a
<i>private</i> should be <i>generally</i> acknowledged as a man
of courage and sobriety. As a standing rule, a
soldier <i>under</i> arms should not be <i>above</i> doing his
duty: though he wears a <i>red coat</i> he must be a
<i>true blue</i>, and <i>peacefully</i> preserve, in every situation,
the articles of <i>war</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bear in mind, boys, that I shall tell you of
many places where I have never been, and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>battles that I have never seen. Much have I
talked with old soldiers and sailors in my time
and much have they told me. It may happen
that in speaking of ships I may be, now and then,
‘out of my reckoning,’ and a little ‘disorderly’
at times, in describing things belonging to the
army, for we are all of us liable to commit mistakes,
and no doubt I make as many as other
people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The more you tell us of the army and navy
the better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I will do my best for you. Let me
here give you one of my general rules for the
conduct of a good soldier. The <i>advanced guard</i>
should <i>fall back</i> from every dishonourable action,
and every <i>rear-rank</i> man should set a bold <i>front</i>
against insubordination.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that is a capital rule. Please now to
tell us what was the very beginning of soldiers
and sailors?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would puzzle the horse-guards and the
Admiralty to tell you. Sailors I suppose began
with ships; and father Noah, who commanded
the good ship the Ark, was the first sailor that
I ever heard of. As to soldiers, we must confine
ourselves to our own country, for we know very
little about the soldiers of the earliest nations of
the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please to tell us, then, the beginning of English
soldiers?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“We must go back to the time when the Romans
invaded England. The British soldier was
then rude in discipline and dress, but intrepidity
marked his every action, as it does now. As the
Roman soldiers descended from their ships the
undaunted Britons rushed into the sea to attack
them, and the flower of Cæsar’s troops were astonished
and fear-struck by their fierce and dauntless
bearing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had they red coats and guns, as they have
now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! no! their dress was of a very different
kind: and the trade of gun-making was unknown
among them. Their arms were clubs, short swords,
and spears. Their cavalry had chariots, to the
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron,
resembling scythe-blades; and their infantry went
to war in long vehicles much like our waggons,
from which they alighted and fought on foot,
jumping into them again, and driving off, when it
suited their purpose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had we any sailors at that time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fancy not: if we had they must have been
very different to what British sailors are now, or
they would have met their invaders on the deep,
and not have allowed them to set their feet on
the shores of old England unmolested. Offa, one
of the Saxon kings, had a fleet, and King Alfred
invited over from abroad ship-builders, to build
vessels, and mariners to man them. The ships
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>were, however, comparatively small. In the time
of Henry VIII., and especially in that of Elizabeth,
the British navy became formidable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when did soldiers begin to dress as they
do now, and to have guns, and pistols, and cannon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These things were brought about by degrees.
I have read that the soldiers of the Anglo-Saxons
were mostly foot-soldiers, though some of them
fought on horseback; but when William the Conqueror
came, soldiers were mostly cavalry. Under
the feudal system, if a man held land to a certain
amount, called a ‘knight’s fee,’ he was obliged
to serve the crown a period of forty days every
year at his own expense, finding a horse, a helmet,
a coat of mail, a shield, and a lance. After that,
spear-men, battle-axe men, cross-bow men, and
archers made their appearance; but when gunpowder
was found out, it made a wonderful difference
in the army.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt it did. Bows and arrows would
not do against guns and cannon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At first fire-arms were very imperfectly made,
and then British bowmen, being strong, brave, and
skilful, were very formidable; but the bravest
archers that ever drew an arrow to the head
would make a poor stand now against British
soldiers. The Artillery Company of London had
once a company of bowmen attached to them, but
they have long since put down the bow, and taken
up the musket.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“All boys remember about Robin Hood, and
his merry men in Nottingham Forest; and about
William Tell, the Swiss archer, shooting the apple
off his son’s head.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt they do. At the battle of Cressy,
in France, two thousand British bowmen drew
their shafts against as many French bowmen.
But now for the beginning of the British army.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, now for the British army!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The army began with the guards that attended
the king, though their weapons and uniform
were very different to those that the household
troops now use and wear. Whatever armed
attendants monarchs may have had around
their persons from the earliest times, there was
no regular body of armed men appointed as guards
till the reign of Richard the First. Richard instituted
a body of twenty-four archers, and called
them the ‘sergeants-at-arms.’ Their duty was to
keep watch round the tent of the king, clad in
complete armour with a bow, arrows, and a sword.
Henry VII. established, in 1485, a band of fifty
archers, all chosen men, to attend him; they were
called ‘Yeomen of the Guard.’ This body still
forms part of the royal establishment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The yeomen of the guard hardly look like
soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True: the commencement of the present regular
army may be said to be the corps of life-guards
established by King Charles II. at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Restoration. To these he added a regiment of
horse-guards, with two regiments of foot-guards.
A regiment of foot-guards was raised also in Scotland.
These corps are what are usually called
the British household troops; and the additions of
horse and foot soldiers since made, constitute the
British army as it exists at the present day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The guards, then, are the oldest regiment of
any soldiers we have?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are. In the year 1679 the corps of
life-guards were thus described:—‘The guards of
horse—which the Spaniards call <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">guardes de á caballo</span></i>;
the French, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guardes du corps</span></i>; the Germans,
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">leibguarde</span></i>; and we, life-guards, that is the
guards of the King’s body—do consist of six hundred
horsemen, well armed and equipped; and are,
for the most part, reformed officers, and young
gentlemen of very considerable families, who are
there made fit for military commands. They are
divided into three troops, viz. the King’s troops,
distinguished by their blue ribbons and carbine
belts, their red hooses and houlster caps, embroidered
with his Majesty’s cypher and crown.
The Queen’s troop, by green ribbons, carbine belts
covered with green velvet and gold lace; also
green hooses and houlster caps, embroidered with
the same cypher and crown. And the duke’s
troop, by yellow ribbons and carbine belts, and
yellow hooses, embroidered as the others. In each
of which troops are two hundred gentlemen, besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>officers. There are four gentlemen who
command as officers, but have no commissions,
viz. sub-corporals or sub-brigadiers.’ The ranks
of the life-guards are not at the present time recruited
with sons of the higher classes, aspiring to
commissions, but with men of good repute, generally
sons of persons in a respectable sphere of life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The life-guards are fine looking fellows!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_b_018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“In 1716, when George I. visited Hanover,
the Prince of Wales, who was then left guardian
of the kingdom, reviewed the brigade of life and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>horse-grenadier-guards, in Hyde Park, November
21st, when he declared them to be one of the
finest bodies of men in person, appearance, and
exercise that the world had ever produced. A
life-guardsman, as he is seen at the Horse Guards
at the present time, is indeed an imposing sight.
We must not, however, be led astray by the size
of men, nor by their gay regimentals. Many a
foot-soldier in his coarse grey great-coat, and his
knapsack on his back, has a heart in his bosom as
brave as that of a life-guardsman!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! a little man may be quite as brave as
a big man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have somewhere heard the remark that ‘all
great men are little men,’ but there is not much
truth in it, though many great military commanders
have been of small stature: Alexander
the Great, and Napoleon Buonaparte among them.
The body, after all, let its stature be what it may,
is of little value compared to the mind. The one
is the leathern scabbard, the other the finely
tempered sword. The poet has well expressed
himself:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Were I so tall to reach the pole,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or grasp the ocean with my span,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must be measured by my soul;—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The mind’s the standard of the man!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“In a military paper that I have seen, the
regulation given by King Charles II. runs thus:—‘Each
horseman to have for his defensive arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>back, breast, and pot; and for his offensive arms,
a sword, and a case of pistolls, the barrels
whereof are not to be under foorteen inches in
length; and each trooper of our guards to have
a carbine, besides the aforesaid arms. And the
foote do haue each souldier a sword, and each pikeman
a pike of sixteen foote long, and not under;
and each musquetteer a musquet, with a collar of
bandaliers, the barrels of which musquet to be
about foor foote long, and to conteine a bullet,
foorteen of which shall weigh a pound weight.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How very particularly they are described!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the war with Holland broke out in
1672, a regiment of dragoons was raised, when
the soldiers therein were ordered to carry halbards,
pistolls with holsters, matchlock, musquet, a collar
of bandaliers, and one bayonet or ‘great knife.’
The arms of dragoons in 1687, (James II.’s
reign,) were, snap-hanse-musquets, strapt with
bright barrels of three foote eight inches long, cartouch
boxes, bayonets, granado pouches, buckets,
and hammer-hatchets.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They called a bayonet, then, a great knife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They did. Since then, regiment has been
added to regiment, till the army has arrived at its
present state. It is now, perhaps, about a hundred
and twenty thousand strong, and is spread
over Great Britain, Ireland, and our possessions in
other quarters of the Globe—undoubtedly the first
soldiers in the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Then we have got the best soldiers and the
best sailors?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed we have! I believe there are neither
sailors nor soldiers in any quarter of the world that
would be a match for an equal number of British
blue-jackets and red-coats. If ever you should go
on board a King’s ship you will be surprised at the
order and discipline that prevail, from the figure-head
to the rudder, from the main-mast head to
the hold. Discipline is everything in the army
and navy, and I shall give you, by and by,
some striking instances that set forth its use and
abuse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What daring fellows sailors are!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If British sailors are daring in battle, they are
equally so in braving all dangers to save the lives
of others. A Flemish brig in a heavy gale struck
on a shoal, to windward of Ostend harbour, and
the crew clung to the rigging for safety, as the
vessel was fast going to pieces. Several Flemish
boats attempted to get to the wreck in vain, and
the crew seemed doomed to destruction. It happened,
however, that a Deal galley was in the
harbour, and the little band of daring tars aboard
her were somewhat more accustomed to such
scenes. They launched their light bark, and
though every sea hid them from view, and every
breaker covered them with foam, they persevered,
undiscouraged by repeated failures, until they
reached the wreck, and saved every man that was
found in her.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Noble! noble! It is pleasant to hear of such
things! It makes us think better of sailors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some time ago a French sloop was stranded
near the port of Dover, when some English fishermen,
who are half sailors, directly put off for the
sloop and rendered effectual service. ‘Your opposite
neighbours, the French,’ said a spectator afterwards,
‘are not quite so ready to help you.’
‘Maybe not,’ replied the fisherman; ‘maybe not;
but we do our duty to the unfortunate without
troubling ourselves about that matter. An English
seaman don’t learn his manners on the deck of a
French ship.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well done, fisherman!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Presence of mind and intrepidity are qualities
very common among British soldiers and sailors.
I will give you an anecdote that I read the other
day, of a soldier. ‘When Buonaparte was preparing
his flotillas, and his soldiers, to invade Old
England, we expected every day to hear of his
being at sea, so we all kept ready at the barracks,
to act at a moment’s warning. One night, when
we were snugly tucked up in bed, news came
suddenly, that the French had landed. One of
our trumpeters was a black, a tall strapping fellow,
more than six feet high, and he was so frightened
that when he took up his trumpet to sound an
alarm, he let it fall from his hand and fainted
away. A bold fellow, who happened at the time
to be at his elbow, snatched up the trumpet from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the ground, and blew a blast that made the barracks
and the barrack-yard ring again. Up we
jumped, hurried on our clothes, ran to the stables,
leaped on our horses, and in eight minutes and a
half every man of us was drawn up in the barrack-yard
ready for action.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The poor black must have been half frightened
out of his senses.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He certainly was; and it was all very well
that, being unable to do his duty, another was
ready to do it for him. On common occasions,
however, a soldier should attend to his own duty,
and not intermeddle with that of his comrades.
A <i>gunner</i> may prove himself a good <i>swordsman</i>, a
<i>riding-master</i> may be a capital <i>walker</i>, and a <i>foot-soldier</i>
may know how to manage a <i>horse</i>, but let
each keep to his own duty. It would be bad indeed
for a <i>drummer</i> to be his own <i>trumpeter</i>, and
still worse for a <i>fifer</i> to be <i>drummed</i> out of his
regiment for bad conduct.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What handy and hearty fellows sailors are,
uncle; we have just seen one, and he gave us
such a hearty cheer!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It has been said, that a British sailor can only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>give free vent to his feelings by a hearty cheer.
It is his mode of thanksgiving for a benefit received;
with a cheer he honours his friend, defies
his enemy, and proclaims a victory. Sailors may
be hearty, but how do you make them out to be
handy? In many things they are the clumsiest
fellows in the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you say so! What are they clumsy in
doing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! in things without number. In the first
place, they are bad hands at passing by a messmate
in distress without relieving him; then they
know nothing about running away from danger;
you cannot teach them, any how, to forget an old
friend; and they are the awkwardest fellows in
the world in striking their colours when alongside
an enemy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right! you are right, uncle. About
half an hour ago a sailor came up to us, and said
that ‘Poor Jack’ was ‘in shallow water,’ and
that, having nothing in his ‘bread-room,’ he would
let us have a real India silk handkerchief for little
or nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And did you buy his handkerchief of him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, uncle. But we were so pleased with what
he told us of his cruises, and battles, and shipwrecks,
that we gave him all the money we
had.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, well, that would answer his purpose quite
as well. It is possible that you may have fallen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>in with a ‘true blue,’ but I am very doubtful. It
was but last week that a fellow accosted me with
the old story about a ‘King’s ship.’ ‘The winds
blowing great guns in the Bay of Biscay, O!’
‘breakers ahead!’ a ‘lee shore and a wreck!’ but
he had stumbled on a Tartar; for a few questions
about sea affairs made him look all manner of
ways at once, and it was a clear case that he
would have willingly given up a part of his ill-gotten
prize-money to have secured a retreat. At
first I used him tenderly, treating him with only
a few points of the compass backwards—north-by-west,
north-north-west, north-west-by-north, north-west,
north-west-by-west, and west-north-west.
This was, as I well knew, all Dutch to him. Seeing
him look rather queerish, I opened upon him
with my ‘tiller-ropes,’ ‘gun-tackle,’ ‘mizzen-jears,’
‘jib-halyard,’ ‘fore-braces,’ ‘deep-sea-line-blocks,’
‘top-sail-sheet-bits,’ ‘main-top bow-lines,’ and
‘ringtail-booms,’ until he looked as frightened as
if I had been a wild man of the woods. At last,
seeing that he was preparing to scud before the
wind, I poured in a broadside of ‘Brail up and
haul down the main-top-mast stay-sail!’ ‘Bear
a hand, my hearty!’ ‘Man well the lee-brail,
and down haul!’ ‘Gather in the slack o’ the
weather brail!’ ‘Let go the halyards!’ ‘Ease
off the sheet!’ ‘Haul down, and brail up briskly!’
‘There! let go the tack, and stop the sail
to the lee-fore-rigging!’ ‘What! are you off?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>then up all hammocks!’ ‘Prepare for action!’
‘Fire to the larboard!’ And away ran the
rogue, forgetting how he had been wounded by
a nine-pounder, as nimbly as though a press-gang
had been at his heels.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It served him right, uncle! that it did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A true-hearted sailor would rather take in a
reef of the main-top-sail in a hurricane than skulk
about in such a manner under false colours.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some time since a Jack-tar, seated in a wherry,
was rowed up the river Thames, against wind
and tide. He had just returned from India; and,
sailor-like, was industriously disposed to get rid
of his spare cash. He had a pipe in his mouth,
and the clouds of smoke poured forth showed that
the smoker was in earnest; while with his right
hand he flourished a flexible bamboo. Behind him
was a large shaggy Newfoundland dog, who appeared
as well pleased as Jack himself. Before
him sat a musician, with a huge drum and pandean
pipes, playing away with all his power.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As Jack passed the vessels in the river, and
the wharfs, and the drinking-rooms overlooking
the water, he was cheered continually. When he
arrived at St. Katherine’s Docks he quitted the
wherry, and hopped along on his real leg, for his
other was a wooden one, as nimbly as a kangaroo,
while the spectators, assembled to witness his landing,
greeted him with a cheer. Jack and the
Newfoundlander were soon stowed in a coach; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>musician occupied the roof, striking up ‘Rule
Britannia!’ and the crowd loudly cheered as Jack
drove off, waving his hat good-humouredly from
the coach window. What became of Jack afterwards
is not known; but it is easy to imagine, that
at the end of a few days’ cruise he would not have
a single shot in his locker.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then he would be off to sea again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt he would. Whether at sea or on
land, seamen seldom keep out of squalls long
together.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the real meaning of a squall?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A squall is a violent gust of wind, that comes
on a ship suddenly, and sometimes does a great deal
of mischief in a very little time. There are parts
of the world where you are more liable to them
than in others. The first time that I was in a
squall in the Mediterranean it put the surprise
upon me. There was a small black cloud to windward
in the south, but I should have thought little
of it, had not a bluff old tar pointed to it and said,
‘There’s a capful, my hearty.’ What he said was
true enough, and we had it in quick time too.
The course of the ship was altered, to scud before
what was coming, and the hands went aloft to
take in sail. By this time the cloud had spread
and neared us, and all at once, without warning,
the squall came. The sheets and ropes cracked
and snapped in the wind, the fore-sail was torn to
ribands, the rain fell like a torrent, and away went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the ship, running almost gunwale down in the
water. But if the squall came without notice, it
quitted us without notice, for in half an hour the
sky was clear, the wind down, and the ship all in
order, making her way through the waves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When a squall comes on, sailors should get
out their anchors, and the strongest cables they
have, to keep the ship steady.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The cables must be very long, boys, to enable
them to anchor in the middle of the Mediterranean.
Perhaps you have never read the account
given by Captain Hall, of attempting to
anchor in deep water with a chain cable!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, never! Please to tell us all about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have it at hand here, and will read it to
you. He says, ‘The chain cable is difficult of
management in deep water; that is to say, when
the soundings are more than twenty or twenty-five
fathoms. Nothing is so easy as getting the anchor
to the bottom in such cases; it is the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facilis descensus</span></i>
with a vengeance! But when the anchor
is to be pulled up again, then comes the tug. I
once let go my anchor, with a chain cable bent to
it, in forty-five fathoms, without having calculated
on the probable effects of the momentum. Though
the cable was bitted, all the stoppers snapped like
packthread; and the anchor, not content with
shooting to the bottom with an accelerated velocity,
drew after it more than a hundred fathoms
of chain, in such fearful style that we thought the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>poor ship must have been shaken to pieces. The
noise was like that of rattling thunder, and so loud
that it was impossible to hear a word; indeed it
was even difficult to speak, from the excessive
tremour caused by the rapid and violent passage
of the links, as the chain leaped, or rather flew up
the hatchway, flashing round the bits, and giving
out sparks like a fire-work. Finally, it tore its
way out at the hawse-hole, till the whole cable
had probably piled itself on the anchor in a pyramid
of iron at the bottom of the sea. The inner
end of the cable had, of course, been securely
shackled round the heel of the main-mast, but the
jerk with which it was brought up made the ship
shake from end to end as if she had bumped on
a rock; and every one fully expected to see the
links fly in pieces about the deck, like chain-shot
fired from a cannon. It cost not many seconds
of time for the cable to run out, but it occupied
several hours of hard labour to heave it in again.
The ordinary power of the capstan, full manned,
scarcely stirred it; and at the last, when to the
weight of chain hanging from the bows there came
to be added that of the anchor, it was necessary
to apply purchase upon purchase in order to drag
the ponderous mass once more to the bows.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How it must have frightened them when the
anchor and chain cable ran out in that way!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“British tars are not very soon frightened,
though I dare say that it made them look about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>them. If you are in the mood to listen to a
laughable story, I can tell you a very curious tale
of a sailor’s marriage that happened some time
since. It was told me a few days after the ceremony.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you? Please to begin it at once. Please
do!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, you shall have it without delay,
as nearly as I can remember, in the language in
which it was related to me. That the story has
been a little embellished there can be no doubt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some years ago, a certain church in the metropolis
stood in need of repair; and the bishop gave
order that such marriages only should be solemnized
therein as had been, before commencing the
repairs, proposed by banns three times, but that in
cases where the banns had not been put up three
times, the marriages should be deferred until they
had been regularly proposed at a neighbouring
church, recently erected. No wonder that this arrangement
occasioned some sad disappointments.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, that would disappoint those that came
to the church to be married, and could not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On Monday morning a jolly Jack-tar hove in
sight, rigged out excellently; under his convoy
was his sweetheart Poll, who bore down gallantly,
her sky-scrapers fluttering in the wind. After a
little heeling to larboard and starboard on the part
of Jack, he came with Poll into safe moorings,
entering the church door under a press of sail.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“We can just fancy that we see them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As Poll stood up the middle aisle, with her
pendants flying, she seemed a prize fit for an
admiral, and Jack himself was as right and tight
a bit of craft as could be seen on this side the
Channel. Jack was not long in hailing Mr. Parson,
and in giving him to understand that he was
bound for Cape Matrimony!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s so like a sailor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On looking over the banns-book, however,
the worthy minister discovered that Jack’s marriage
had been proposed twice at that church, and
once at the new church, and, therefore, in conformity
with the order of the bishop, the banns
had to be put up twice more in the new church
before the marriage could be solemnized.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did the sailor say to that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No sooner was this made intelligible to Jack
than he began to overhaul the minister with a
little of his old-fashioned lingo. ‘Wait a fortnight,
Mr. Parson! No that I won’t for the
West Indies; so you may just as well give over
your palavering, and pick up your book. I came
here to be spliced, and spliced I’ll be. Wait a
fortnight! that’s a good un! Why, haven’t we
made signals for three Sundays? how long would
you keep us cruising about, while you are in snug
quarters? The long and the short of it is this:
Poll and me have come here to be spliced, and
we’ll wait a fortnight for nobody.’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“The sailor spoke his mind pretty freely, however.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The minister, knowing the free habits of
sailors, bore Jack’s observations with great good
humour, but told him it was utterly impossible to
marry him. ‘I am sorry for it,’ said he, ‘but if
you were to give me the navy of England I could
not marry you.’ This remark was a broadside
that almost laid Jack on his beam-ends, but he
plucked up his spirit, went on another tack, and
instead of rashly boarding his opponent, tried to
enter on a friendly parley. ‘Why, look you, Mr.
Parson,’ said he, ‘I’ll tell you how the land lies.
I shall be off in a few days on a cruise, and if I
goes to sea, and leaves Poll in port, she’ll get
spliced to somebody else, before I comes back
again, so you see I can’t wait a fortnight.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! oh! oh! Then he was afraid to trust
Poll, though he was going to marry her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jack’s rhetoric, however, was all in vain, for
the minister told him, that if he must be married
that day, there was no other way than going to
Doctors’ Commons for a license. ‘And who’s
Doctor Commons,’ inquired Jack; ‘and what will
the shiners be?’ No sooner were these questions
answered, than away goes Jack. ‘Never mind,
Poll; never mind, Mr. Parson! I’ll soon be back.’
Saying this, he quits the church, jumps into a
coach at the coach-stand near the church gates,
and gets under weigh to Doctors’ Commons, telling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the coachman, that if he did not sail right afore the
wind he should get no shot out of his locker.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The sailor was in right earnest about the
matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The morning was wearing away, and there
was but little time to spare, but Jack came back
in as fine style as if he were chasing an enemy’s
frigate. Nimbly as a harlequin he skips along
the churchyard, and makes for the altar, holding
the license in his hand, crying out ‘All’s right,
Poll! all’s right, Mr. Parson! Here’s the bit o’
paper! plenty of time. Never mind, Poll! all’s
right!’ It was of little use that the clergyman
tried to prevail on Jack to behave with the gravity
and decorum fitting the place and the occasion,
so much were his spirits excited. When the
clergyman examined the paper, he found, so far
from things being all right, that all was wrong,
for the license set forth that the marriage was to
take place at the new church, and not at the
church they were then in. ‘Never mind, Poll!
Never mind, Mr. Parson! plenty of time!’ cried
out the undaunted sailor; and what with pushing
Poll, and hurrying on the parson, he got them into
another hackney coach, and set off for the new
church—the distance was very short.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He deserved to be married, for all his trouble;
surely he was not again disappointed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seemed as though poor Jack was to be
weather-bound, for on every fresh tack the wind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>was against him. No marriages being expected
that morning at the new church, the high iron
gate was closed, and the sexton, who had the key,
was not there. Now the iron gate would have
been but a trifling impediment to Jack, but it was
an effectual barrier to Poll and the parson.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Jack would soon have mounted over the
gate, no doubt, had he been by himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At last the key was procured, the clerk was
in attendance, and the whole party proceeded with
all necessary despatch down the long gravel walk
to the church. Jack every now and then crying
out, ‘Never mind, Poll! Never mind, Mr. Parson!
plenty of time!’ The time, however, grew very
short, and the worthy minister was obliged to do
his best to prevent any disappointment taking
place; but when he hurried to the vestry, where
the robes were kept, the door was locked. There
was no time to send for the key. It was a case
of necessity, and the kind-hearted clergyman resolving
to do all he could, proceeded to the altar
without his surplice, that he might begin the service
in time, for not a moment was there to lose.
What was his annoyance to find that the Book of
Prayer was not there. So closely was he driven
for time that, after despatching a boy to a neighbouring
house for a Prayer Book, he began the
service trusting to his memory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he had not been a good-natured clergyman
he never would have done all that.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“No doubt a Prayer Book might have been
found in one of the pews, but there was nobody
present who could be spared to look for one, and
the time for beginning had been delayed till the
last moment. To the great relief of the clergyman,
the boy soon returned with the book he had
brought, but when the worthy minister opened it
he found that instead of a Prayer Book, it was a
Bible!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We never heard of so many hindrances to
anything before in our lives.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Further delay was out of the question; there
was no time for him to go back for another book,
so the clergyman, trusting to his memory, completed
the ceremony without one, to the great joy
of the married couple. No sooner was the ceremony
over than Jack, who could not be restrained,
capered about in a most indecorous manner. He
danced his way along the aisle, slapt the kind-hearted
minister on the back, called him a ‘true-blue,’
and a ‘hearty good fellow,’ and declared it
would do him good if Mr. Parson would join him
in drinking Poll’s health in a bumper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, that is the oddest tale we ever heard.
Poor Jack was married to Poll after all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was: but if you are to know anything
about the military and naval duties of soldiers
and sailors, I must not relate many such long and
laughable stories.”</p>

East Indies.—The Articles of War in the Army and the Navy.—The
Sentinel and St. Paul’s Cathedral.—Mutilation among foreign
Troops.—The reckless Irishman.—His mad freak.—His lighthearted
observation.—His sentence.—Discipline on board the
Atalanta.—The selfish severity of a sea captain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will now say a word or two on discipline,
because without it an army of soldiers would be a
lawless and uncontrollable mob; a mere reckless
rabble, almost as dangerous to their friends as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>their enemies: nothing like steadiness and discipline!
One <i>slow step</i> in the path of <i>duty</i> is better
than the <i>double march</i> in that of <i>insubordination</i>.
It is discipline that keeps the army and the navy
of England in order.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is discipline? Is it flogging those that
do wrong and disobey orders?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Discipline is the instruction, as well as the control
of soldiers, sailors, and marines. Bravery alone
would never enable men to discharge their duty
in the field; it is discipline which renders their
strength, skill, and bravery efficient. A good
soldier should have somewhat to hope; a bad
one should have something to fear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A soldier’s exercise is a part of his discipline;
is it not, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is, and a very important part, too; what
may seem to you of no consequence, is of real
value in the discipline of the army. Every, even
the least, important movement in military affairs,
is a link in the chain of discipline that cannot be
dispensed with without loss. The act of standing
in a proper position may be thought a trifle, yet,
in military tactics, it is of great importance. If a
soldier cannot stand properly he cannot step properly,
and still less can he march, countermarch,
face, wheel, and perform the various evolutions
required of him; in which case he is not only
less efficient himself, but also a hindrance to his
comrades.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“We never thought standing properly was of
half so much consequence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you reflect, boys, for a moment, common
sense will tell you, that if one man stands upright
and another crooked; if one takes up a
little space, and another a great deal; if one
makes a long step and another a short one; if
one be quick in his movements and another slow,
confusion must of necessity follow, and no officer
can calculate either on the ground which the
troops under him will occupy or the time they
will take up in their marches and evolutions. If
obedience be the first duty of a soldier, order is
the second.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the next thing that is learnt by a
soldier after position?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must not expect me to explain all that is
taught in the army. My account must be a sort
of running fire; a touch and go on, or I shall
never find time to tell one half that I have to say.
I said, that a proper position was of consequence,
and so it is. In whatever <i>position</i>, however, a
soldier may be, he should never <i>stand with his
back to an enemy</i>, and when his <i>eyes</i> are <i>right</i>, his
<i>heart</i> never should be <i>wrong</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Soldiers are sometimes very young. One that
passed us yesterday was not above twenty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very likely. There are many that go abroad
very young. Some time ago three hundred men,
belonging to the 89th regiment of foot, came from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Chatham to Gravesend, with their newly appointed
officers. They all went on board the East India
ship the Bombay, their destination being the East
Indies. Among the whole three hundred not one
was twenty years of age.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are articles of war, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Articles of war are express rules and orders,
drawn up for the navy, as well as for the army, that
sailors and soldiers may know, if they commit an
offence, what penalties they incur. The articles of
war in the navy are enacted by act of parliament,
and contain almost every possible offence that a
sailor can commit. The articles of war in the
army are not enacted by act of parliament, but
have been framed from time to time at the pleasure
of the Crown.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But do all soldiers and sailors know the articles
of war?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They do, or ought to know the principal of
them, for in every ship in the royal navy they are
hung up in the most public place, and beside this,
they are ordered to be read to the ship’s company
at least once a month.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are they read to soldiers too?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The principal of them are. Some offences
are punishable with death, and some with lighter
penalties.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What offences can be punishable with death
among soldiers?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Any officer or soldier who shall begin, excite,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>cause, or join in any mutiny or sedition, or be present
without trying to suppress it, or delay to give
information; or shall desert the service,—or hold
correspondence with, or give information to the
enemy,—or abandon his post, or quit his colours
to go in search of plunder; or strike, or offer to
strike a superior officer—any officer or soldier
doing these things is liable to suffer death, transportation,
or such other punishment as by a general
court-martial shall be awarded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, these offences would be very bad, certainly,
for a soldier to commit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are other crimes also punishable with
death; such as when a soldier disobeys lawful commands;
or does violence when in foreign parts to
any one bringing in provisions; or treacherously
makes known the watchword to any one not entitled
to receive it; or intentionally occasions
false alarms in action or camp; or casts away
his arms in presence of an enemy; or sleeps
at his post,—for a <i>sentinel</i> on the <i>watch</i> of
duty should <i>keep guard</i> over himself. I will tell
you something strange about a soldier sleeping
at his post. It is said that a sentinel, in troublous
times, found lying at full length on the
ground, was tried by a court-martial for neglect
of duty. The poor fellow was in great danger of
being shot. When called upon for his defence, he
said, that he was not asleep, but only listening to
discover any approaching sound, and that while in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>that attitude he distinctly heard the big bell of
St. Paul’s cathedral strike <i>thirteen</i>. This was of
course not believed; for, in the first place, it was
doubted whether the clock of St. Paul’s could be
heard at all at such a distance from London, and
in the next, it was not at all likely that it would
strike thirteen. Strange, however, as the thing
appeared, it turned out to be true, for on inquiry,
it was proved beyond a doubt that the clock did
on that night, owing to some unaccountable circumstance,
strike thirteen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, that was a strange thing indeed! The
poor soldier would never forget the clock of St.
Paul’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the articles of war, any soldier who shall
intentionally injure his eyes, or maim himself by
firing off his piece or otherwise, is liable to the
loss of his pay and pension, in addition to other
punishment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do soldiers ever do such things as those?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes! Many instances of the kind have
occurred. I remember that when the Turkish
Sultan fought against Mehemet Ali, the men required
for the army in Egypt so little liked the
service, that when sent off to join their corps, some
knocked out their teeth, others blinded themselves,
and numbers made themselves cripples, so that by
far the greater number had to be sent back. In
order to put a stop to this course of proceeding his
highness, the viceroy, issued an order to the governors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of the different districts, that every soldier
who maimed or disabled himself should, in future,
be sent to the galleys for life, and that some relation
of his should be chosen to supply his place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But did you ever hear of any man in the British
army doing anything of the kind?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have, boys, but listen to me. I knew an
Irishman, a daring reckless fellow as ever pulled a
trigger, or mounted the breach on a forlorn hope.
He served in India; and in wading a swamp, in
charging the enemy, or in storming a stockade,
never sure was his equal; but what of all that?
he was, at the best, but a bad soldier.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pat feared no danger. But a soldier’s first duty
is obedience, and this duty he could never practise.
He was an idle, swearing, swaggering, drunken
fellow. It was no use trying to reclaim him, for
imprisonment, piquetting, and tying him up to the
halberds, produced no reformation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some of the privates in Pat’s regiment were
invalided, and were on the point of returning to Old
England, and Pat was determined to return too.
Another man would have thought the matter over
coolly, but Pat had no thought in him; so, splitting
a brace of bullets into half a dozen pieces, and
ramming them into his pistol, he pulled the trigger,
and sent the whole charge through his left
hand, that he might be invalided.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was close beside him when the regimental
surgeon came in to examine his hand. After feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>among the shattered bones for some time,—‘I
can save the thumb and finger,’ cried the surgeon;
and taking out his instruments, in a few minutes
he had removed the whole of the shattered hand,
all but the thumb and finger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would have thought that, what with the
pistol-charge and the surgeon’s knife, Pat’s Irish
heart would have been conquered—but no, nothing
like it.—‘What do you guess, now, I am
thinking about?’ said he to the surgeon. ‘Can’t
guess at all,’ replied the surgeon. ‘Why,’ said
Pat, coolly, ‘sure enough I was thinking that I
should take a pinch of snuff yet, with my odd
thumb and finger when I got home to my mother
in ould Ireland.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pat got neither prize-money nor promotion
by this mad freak, for a court-martial awarded
him a thousand lashes. The greater part of his
punishment, however, was remitted; he was sent
up the country to be a sweeper in a fort, and,
for aught I know to the contrary, he may be there
still. Pat was a drunkard, and when a soldier gives
way to drinking, farewell to his good character and
his dreams of promotion! Drunkenness is of itself
a degrading vice, and it leads a man on into almost
every other. Now, with such characters as Pat,
how could the army be kept together without discipline?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very true. Discipline must be kept up in the
army, and indeed in the navy too.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“I will give you, boys, two striking instances
of the effect of discipline on board ship. They
are taken from the Supplement to the Saturday
Magazine, though I believe they were at first related
by that excellent and well-informed officer,
Captain Basil Hall, in his interesting ‘Fragments
of Voyages and Travels.’ The first instance will
show you the great advantage of steadiness and
discipline in circumstances of danger. His Majesty’s
ship Atalanta, commanded by Captain Hickey,
in November 1813, was standing in for Halifax
harbour, in one of the thick fogs so frequent on
that coast, when it unhappily mistook the signal-guns
of another vessel, in the same situation, for
those which are fired during such weather from
Sambo Rock, as guides to ships entering the harbour;
the consequence was, that the Atalanta
struck on the rocks, and the first blow carried
away the rudder, half the stern-post, together
with great part of the false keel, and, it is believed,
a portion of the bottom. The ship instantly
filled with water, and was buoyed up
merely by the empty casks, till the decks and
sides were burst and riven asunder by the waves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The captain, who throughout continued as composed
as if nothing remarkable had occurred, then
ordered the guns to be thrown overboard; but before
this could be even attempted, the ship fell over
so much that the men could not stand. In lowering
the boats for the crew to take to, one, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>jolly-boat, was lost; the ship was now fast falling
over on her beam-ends, and directions were given
to cut away the masts; but the crash caused the
ship to part in two, and a few seconds afterwards
she again broke right across, between the fore and
main-masts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A considerable crowd of men had got into
the pinnace (or boat), in hopes that she might
float as the ship sunk; but the captain, seeing
that the boat was overloaded, desired some twenty
men to quit her, and his orders were as promptly
obeyed as they were coolly given, so completely
was discipline maintained by the character of the
commander, and consequent confidence of the crew.
The pinnace then floated, but was immediately
upset by a sea; the people in her, however, imitating
the conduct of their captain, retained their
self-possession, and, by great exertions, righted the
boat, and got her clear of the wreck, where, at a
little distance off, they waited further orders from
their captain, who, with forty men, still clung to
the remains of the vessel. It was now, however,
absolutely necessary to quit it, as the wreck was
disappearing rapidly; and in order to enable the
boats to contain them, the men, as removed to the
pinnace, were laid flat in the bottom like herrings
in a cask, while the small boats returned to pick
up the rest, which was at last accomplished with
great difficulty; but, except the despatches, which
had been secured by the captain from the first,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and a chronometer, everything on board was lost.
The pinnace now contained eighty persons, the
cutter forty-two, and the gig eighteen, with which
load they barely floated, the captain being the
very last person to quit the wreck of the ship;
and hardly had he got into the boat when the
last fragments disappeared: three hearty cheers
were given by the gallant crew. The fog
continued as dense as ever, and they had no
means of knowing in which direction to proceed,
and if it had not been for a small compass, which
one man had appended to his watch, for a toy,
it is most probable that they would not yet have
been preserved; at last they were all landed in
safety, about twenty miles from Halifax, nearly
naked, wet through and shivering, and miserably
cramped by the close crowding in the boats. The
captain took the worst provided, and most fatigued,
round to the harbour in the boats, and
the rest, under the officers, marched across the
country in three divisions, with as much regularity
as if going well-appointed on some regular
expedition, though very few had any shoes, and
they had to traverse a country only partially
cleared; the same evening the whole crew, without
one missing, officers, men, and boys assembled
at Halifax in as exact order as if their ship
had met with no accident.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is a very striking account indeed! Captain
Hickey was a noble fellow!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“The second story is tragically different from
the first, and presents one of the most striking pictures
of passive courage ever presented to the contemplation.
A captain of a ship of war, whose
sole object of ambition was to distinguish himself
by capturing an enemy’s vessel, conceived that
his surest mode of obtaining the fulfilment of his
wishes was by disciplining his crew so strictly,
that, in the event of an engagement, he would be
sure of victory by his superiority in this respect;
but, in order to obtain this, he harassed his crew
by such strict regulations, such constant and unremitting
exertions, and such excessive severity,
as to alienate all affection, and to bring his crew
to the verge of insubordination.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The day at length arrived when his expectations
seemed about to be realized. A strange
sail appeared in sight, which was soon made out
to be an enemy. He summoned his crew, and
addressed them in an energetic speech; reminding
them of their duty, and of the glory which awaited
them; he gave orders to clear for action, and was
instantly and scrupulously obeyed. But the hour
of retribution was at hand. His crew knew of his
ambition; knew it to be the source of their suffering,
and determined to be revenged in the fullest
manner. Their own spirit forbad them to do
anything cowardly or mean, but they stood to
their guns, and, when the enemy began the engagement,
they kept their places, and refused to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>return a shot; in vain their commander and his
officers reproached, exhorted, supplicated; with
their arms folded they waited their fate, nor
flinched while broadside after broadside struck
them down. The battle, or rather the attack,
was soon over; the enemy, surprised at the non-resistance,
boarded the English vessel, and found
the officers and their crew nearly all destroyed.
The captain lived long enough to feel the bitter
anguish of disappointment, and to be conscious
of having been the cause; but he fell at last, before
the vessel was taken possession of.”<a id='t49'></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“That was carrying discipline too far, however.
Poor fellows! How those men must have
hated the captain!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt they did. Had not the captain
been blinded by his own selfishness, he would
have seen their discontent. Whether in the service
or out of it, that man who disregards the
feelings of others is not fit to be placed in authority.
When men are tried too much, the heart
is like a full cup, that a drop will make run over.
I was once present when a young officer was very
hard on an old soldier, whom he at last called a
stupid old fool. The veteran at once lost all command
of himself—he stepped from the ranks and
told the young officer, that he had served his country
for years, while he, his officer, had never smelt
gunpowder. The officer had been in the wrong,
and was prudently advised to pass by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>outbreak of the old soldier. Before now, I have
seen men on the very eve of mutiny, when a prudent
and considerate word on the part of an officer,
has broken their proud hearts at once, and brought
them to a sense of their duty. Englishmen hate
oppression, and it ought never to be practised.
When officers temper the discipline of the service
with due consideration, and kindly feeling, soldiers,
sailors, and marines, are ready to follow them
through fire and water.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At Culloden in Scotland the Duke of Cumberland
gained a complete victory over the Scots. It
is said, that the duke’s soldiers practised great
cruelty towards the defenceless inhabitants after
the battle. If so, it was a disgrace to them.
‘<i>Ready</i> and <i>steady</i>,’ is a good maxim for soldiers
and sailors, <i>ready</i> for <i>duty</i> and <i>steady</i> in <i>danger</i>,
but cold-hearted cruelty is a black blot on a soldier’s
brow. The evils of war are bad enough in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>themselves. He is no true-hearted soldier who can
injure the defenceless, whatever be the nation to
which he belongs. Mercy is a Godlike attribute;
practice it, boys, whenever it is in your power.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Those cruel soldiers were not worthy the name
of Englishmen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the battle of Prague the King of Prussia
defeated the Austrians, but the brave Marshal
Schwerin, a Prussian general, there lost his life. At
Minden Prince Ferdinand beat the French, with
great slaughter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Minden?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In Germany. At Quebec the celebrated
Wolfe was killed, dying in the moment of victory.
‘They run! they run!’ said an officer who supported
the dying warrior. ‘Who run?’ inquired
Wolfe eagerly. ‘The French!’ replied the lieutenant.
‘Then,’ said Wolfe, ‘I die happy!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How sad to die just as he had got the victory!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The storming of Seringapatam, and the battle
of Marengo, were two famous engagements; and
the battles in Spain were very numerous. Among
them were those of Corunna, Ciudad Rodrigo,
Badajos, Salamanca, Vittoria, and St. Sebastian.
After all these came the battle of battles, Waterloo,
won by the conqueror of conquerors, Wellington.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a number of battles you have mentioned!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Remember, boys, I am an old soldier, and am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>therefore at home in speaking of them. From
time immemorial there have been battles, and, so
long as men are what they are, there will be; but
for all that it becomes us to encourage a spirit of
peace and good-will to all men. It is only when
the oppressed are to be protected, when injuries
are to be redressed and rights defended, that the
sword ought ever to be drawn from its scabbard,
nor even then if those ends can be obtained by
more peaceable means. In an unworthy cause
battle becomes murder, and victory a polluted and
unholy thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As the battle of Marathon is so often alluded
to in the pages of history, I will just tell you, in
a few words, the particulars of the fight. Marathon
was a village of Attica, about ten miles from
Athens, in Greece; and Miltiades, an Athenian
general, with ten thousand men, though some say
twenty-thousand, defeated, in the adjacent plain,
the Persian army, under Datis, of one hundred
thousand infantry, and ten thousand horse. By
this victory the terror of the Persian power was
dispelled, and the enthusiastic valour of the Greeks
called forth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How long is it since the battle of Marathon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“More than two thousand years. The Grecian
orators, whenever they wanted to excite their
countrymen to warlike deeds, always reminded
them of what ten thousand Athenians achieved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>on the plains of Marathon. The famous siege of
Troy took place almost a thousand years before
then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, then it is three thousand years since
the siege of Troy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is, boys. You know, I dare say, that
Homer composed two poems, the Iliad and the
Odyssey, on the subject; but poets are not often
the most correct historians. After a siege of ten
years, the Greeks took Troy from the Trojans, it
is supposed by stratagem, and then burnt it to
the ground.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! Did they not send a wooden horse into
the place?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So the tale goes. It is said, that the Greeks
caused a large wooden horse to be made, and hid
in it a number of their bravest warriors. They
then pretended to give up the siege. At night,
after the wooden horse had been taken into the
city, the inclosed warriors rushed out, and opened
the gates to their companions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But do you not think the tale is true?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed I do not. Now we are speaking of
ancient battles, I will mention that of Thermopylæ.
Thermopylæ was a narrow defile, leading from
Thessaly into some Grecian districts; it was, indeed,
looked on as the gate of Greece. Here
Leonidas, the Spartan general, with a small band
of devoted warriors, repulsed the army of Xerxes,
King of Persia, consisting, say some, of three million
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>men. Xerxes was amazed and confounded;
but, having been informed of another pass over the
mountains, he availed himself of it. Leonidas
being attacked in the rear by twenty-four thousand
men, and in front by the main body of Persians,
could no longer resist his overwhelming adversary,
but he and every man with him, scorning
to surrender, fought till they died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Battles must be very different now, to what
they used to be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are indeed. Gunpowder has altogether
changed military tactics. Strength and courage
formerly obtained victories, but now, a knowledge
of tactics will often enable a small body of men to
overcome a larger one. A battle should never be
fought when it can be avoided. It is said to be
the last resource of a good general. If skill and
stratagem can attain an object, fighting is altogether
out of the question. When, however, a
battle becomes inevitable, the first thing is to take
advantage of the ground, for oftentimes the possession
of a hill, a thicket, a village, or of a single
building, is of great consequence. If you had been
at Waterloo, and seen what efforts were made to
possess the house called Hougomont, I should have
no occasion to say a word on this point.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why is a hill, or a thicket, or a house, of
so much consequence?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because these things not only protect troops,
but enable them to annoy their enemies by preventing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>them from forming, and picking off their
officers. It is a great advantage, also, in a battle,
to have the wind and sun in your favour; to meet
an enemy with the wind and dust against you,
and the sun in your eyes, is very trying. The
artillery should be distributed with great care, for
it forms, in most cases, the principal strength of
an army; and the horse and foot should be posted
on ground the fittest for their operations.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, how can an army fire cannon without
killing their own soldiers, for they must at times
be mingled together with the enemy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In such a case the artillery moves its position,
and only plays when it can do so on the enemy
alone. The battle array generally consists of three
lines, the front, the rear, and the reserve. An
attacking army is generally divided into three
parts, the main body, and the two wings. And
the battle array is formed by dividing each of
these into three lines, the front, the rear, and the
reserve; the artillery is divided along the front
of the first line, and the treasure, provision, and
baggage, are removed to a safe place before the
engagement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! It must be very necessary to take care
of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Prussia has long been a warlike country; for
Frederick the Great called forth the military
energies of his people. In Prussia, every able-bodied
man of the kingdom is required to perform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>a limited service in the army. At twenty, he
enters the regular army for three years, unless
favoured by some regulation, which limits the
term to one year. From twenty-three to twenty-five
he belongs to the war reserve, when he enters
the first ban of the landwehr, and continues to his
thirty-second year, after which he serves another
seven years in the second ban of the landwehr.
After the fortieth year, he ranks till the fiftieth
in the landsturm, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">levée en masse</span> of the whole
population.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If every one in Prussia is compelled to be a
soldier, why, then, Old England for ever!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Frederick the Great was distinguished for
great talents as a warrior, a statesman, and a man
of science and literature. His enemies were numerous,
his exploits brilliant, and his tactics and
policy eminently successful. Surrounded on all
sides by his foes, he hurried from one part of his
dominions to another with equal celerity, courage,
prudence, and perseverance, and though sorely
tried, overcame all his difficulties, and gained the
name of Frederick the Great.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, he was another Buonaparte!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before the battle of Rosbach, which led to
the most celebrated of all the King of Prussia’s
victories, Frederick addressed his little army, not
amounting to more than twenty-five thousand men,
in nearly the following words:—‘My brave soldiers,
the hour is come in which all that is, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>all that ought to be dear to us, depends upon the
swords that are now drawn for the battle. Time
permits me to say but little, nor is there occasion
to say much. You know that there is no labour,
no hunger, no cold, no watching, no danger, that
I have not shared with you hitherto; and you
now see me ready to lay down my life with you,
and for you. All I ask, is the same pledge of
fidelity and affection that I give. Acquit yourselves
like men, and put your confidence in God.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The effect of this speech was indescribable.
The soldiers answered it by an universal shout,
and their looks and demeanour became animated
to a sort of heroic frenzy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Frederick led on his troops in person, exposed
to the hottest of the fire. The enemy, for a few
moments, made a gallant resistance, but overwhelmed
by the headlong intrepidity of the Prussians,
they, at length, gave way in every part, and
fled in the utmost disorder. Night alone saved
from total destruction the scattered remains of an
army which, in the morning, was double the number
of the conquerors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A speech from a general to his army seems
to do a great deal towards getting a victory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Frederick was an excellent general, and the
soul of perseverance. So severe was the duty in
some of his regiments of cavalry, that war was
said to be a mitigation rather than an addition to
their hardships. Frederick had a very skilful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>general, of the name of De Zeithen, whom he had
somewhat neglected in a time of peace. When
war broke out, he was anxious to avail himself of
his military talents and unequalled courage; but
De Zeithen had too keen a remembrance of the
past neglect to proffer his services. After trying
all other methods in vain, to persuade him to his
wishes, Frederick at last said, he knew that his
old and faithful general, De Zeithen, would never
see his King in difficulty, and deny him his assistance.
De Zeithen’s proud heart was melted by
this appeal of his sovereign, and, falling on his
knees, with tears rolling down his cheeks, he devoted
his sword while he had life to the service of
his King.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Old General Zeithen was won over then.
Frederick knew the way to the old man’s heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When Frederick took the field against his
enemies, in his last war, he was in his sixty-seventh
year. ‘We have all grown old,’ said he to his assembled
officers, ‘in the career of arms, and have
shared together the glories and the fatigues of our
former wars. You are, doubtless, as unwilling as
myself to shed blood, but new dangers, with which
the empire and my territories are alike menaced,
oblige me to take the most efficacious measures to
dissipate the threatening storm. I cannot, therefore,
avoid calling you once more to defend your
country. It will give me the most lively satisfaction
when I shall have to recompense you for your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>fresh services. I shall not appear during the campaign
with a luxurious camp equipage; you know
I have never cared for such a thing; my actual
infirmities will, however, prevent my making the
campaign as I should have done during the vigour
of my life. I shall, in marches, make use of a carriage,
but on a day of battle you may be sure of
seeing me on horseback among you as formerly.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The old King was ready to the last to play
the general.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Charles XII. of Sweden delighted in war, and
never did warrior surpass him in daring; but he
was reckless almost to insanity. At the battle of
Narva, with only twenty thousand men, he defeated
the Czar, Peter the Great, who had, it is said,
one hundred thousand; but at the battle of Pultowa
in Russia, Peter the Great overcame him,
when he fled for safety to the dominions of the
Turk. He died in the trenches of Frederickshall
in Norway, some say by a cannon shot, but others
say by the pistol of one of his own soldiers.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘His fall was destined to a distant strand,</div>
      <div class='line'>A petty fortress, and a dubious hand:</div>
      <div class='line'>He left the name at which the world grew pale</div>
      <div class='line'>To point a moral, or adorn a tale.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Great as Charles thought himself in the field,
Peter the Great was too much for him at last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Peter the Great of Russia was a most extraordinary
man, and a warrior of no common order.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>He came over to England and worked in the dockyard
at Deptford as a shipwright, to improve
himself in the building of ships for his navy; he
learned the trade of a smith, and forged a bar of
iron at Olaneta in Russia, which weighed a hundred
and twenty pounds. What think you, boys, of a
mighty monarch working as a blacksmith, and
making his nobles blow the bellows for him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are very few monarchs that would do
that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Peter the Great won many battles, but the
victory of Pultowa over his rival in arms, Charles
XII. of Sweden, ruined the latter. Peter died in
the fifty-third year of his age, and the great monument
at Petersburgh, erected to his memory, is a
prodigious work of art. The pedestal is a single
stone of red granite, weighing more than fourteen
hundred tons. Peter is represented on horseback,
crowned with laurel, and sitting on a housing of
bear-skin. The horse, a fiery courser, stands on
his hind feet, as if resolved to arrive at the pinnacle
of the rock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be a grand monument, but how the
Russians could contrive to take that big stone to
the place where it was to be set up, is a puzzle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The great Duke of Marlborough was a mighty
and successful warrior. In his grand battle at
Blenheim, on the Danube, besides destroying twelve
thousand French and Bavarians he took thirteen
thousand prisoners, and Marshall Tallard among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>them. It was for this exploit that Blenheim House,
a princely mansion near Oxford, was given to him,
and his heirs. Great as the duke was in military
fame, he at last became childish, and wept
when beaten at chess, saying, ‘Every one can beat
me now?’ You see, boys, how little it becomes
us to be proud, for he who is great to-day may be
little, indeed, to-morrow. While I tell you about
soldiers and sailors, and of the reputation that
many of them have attained, remember, that to be
a great warrior unennobled by proper motives, is
only to be a great destroyer. Aim at uprightness,
usefulness, patriotism, loyalty, honour, and humanity,
and you will then be true friends to your
country.”</p>

fleet.—Captains and commanders.—Full dress of the officers of

<p class='c010'>“I have said nothing of the uniforms worn by
soldiers and sailors, and will now enter a little on
the subject. If you were to see the paintings of
the hearty old admirals in the Naval Gallery of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Greenwich Hospital, they would surprise you. Some
of these tough old tars look as though they would
not alter a brass button of their coats, if it affected
the honour of old England, to prevent the broadside
of an enemy from sending them to the bottom
of the ocean. Their dresses are so odd and so
different one from another that you would hardly
think they were all admirals. Some have long
curled wigs on; some have red coats, some blue,
and some brown; some are clad in armour; some
in buff leathern jerkins; some in loose robes, and
others in red velvet gowns with ermine capes. In
old times there was no fixed uniform for the navy;
and, besides, some of these admirals are painted
as they appeared on state occasions. In the reign
of George II. some of these old heroes, talking
over the subject of dress at one of their clubs,
came to a resolution ‘That a uniform dress is useful
and necessary for commissioned officers, agreeably
to the practice of other nations.’ No sooner
was this resolution passed, than a committee appointed
Admiral Forbes to wait on the Duke of
Bedford, who was then the First Lord of the
Admiralty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And did he go to the duke?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did. He was shown into a room surrounded
with dresses, and the duke asked him
which of them he thought the most suitable?
‘Oh!’ said he, ‘the dress should be either red
and blue, or blue and red, for these are the national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>colours.’ ‘That may be,’ replied his Grace,
‘but the King has settled the matter differently.
He saw my duchess riding in the park the other
day, in a habit of blue faced with white; it took
his fancy, and he has ordered that it shall become
the uniform of the royal navy.’ This uniform of
blue and white was established in the year 1748,
and remained unaltered, as to colour, until a few
years ago, when King William IV. changed the
white facing to a red one. At the present time we
have our national colours blue and red.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But is there no lace about an admiral’s uniform?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes. In 1812 the full dress of the admiral
of the fleet was a coat of blue cloth, with white
cloth lapelles laced, and cuffs, with five laces round
the cuffs. The admirals the same, with only four
laces on the cuffs. The vice-admirals, with only
three laces on the cuffs. The rear-admiral, with
two laces on the cuffs. The captain to the admiral
of the fleet wore the undress or frock-uniform
of rear-admirals. Captains and commanders wore
uniforms of the same pattern. Lieutenants wore
a uniform of the same pattern as captains, but
without lace, and masters’-mates and midshipmen
dressed as they did before. The officers wore epaulettes,
according to their ranks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Epaulettes! What, do officers in the navy
wear epaulettes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! Epaulettes in the navy are of gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>lace; and officers in the army or navy who disgrace
their <i>arms</i> are liable to have their epaulettes
torn from their <i>shoulders</i>. According to an order of
the Admiralty, in 1812, captains above three years
post have two epaulettes, with a silver crown over
a silver anchor; and post-captains under three years,
have two, with a silver anchor without the crown.
Commanders have two plain epaulettes; lieutenants,
one; rear-admirals, two, with a star on the
strap of each; vice-admirals, two stars, and admirals
three stars. Marines used to wear two
silver epaulettes, but, for good conduct, they are
now called royal, and allowed to wear gold epaulettes,
according to the rank they have acquired.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, please to give us the uniform of soldiers;
for that is very striking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I were jesting, boys, I should say, the
most <i>striking</i> part of a soldier is his <i>sword</i>, but
in gravely describing things as they are, I must
say that his dress is the most conspicuous thing
about him. Were soldiers clad in common clothes
their bravery would suffer as much as their appearance
in our estimation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! it would never do for soldiers to dress
in common clothes; we should not know that
they were soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Red and blue are the prevailing colours in the
army. You will, perhaps, like to know something
about the full dress of the officers; the dress of
the men is, of course, of an inferior quality.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Yes. The dress of the officers, if you please.
Some officers that we have seen have cut a very
grand appearance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Passing by, for the present, the dress of general
officers, staff officers, the personal staff attached
to general officers, the staff of garrisons, the Royal
Military College, the Royal Military Asylum, the
Cavalry Depôt, garrison of Chatham, and the civil
departments, I will come at once to the dress of
officers of regiments of cavalry. These are, as I
have told you, the life-guards, the royal regiment
of horse-guards, the dragoon-guards, and heavy
dragoons, the light dragoons, the lancers and the
hussars. As changes are often introduced in the
dress of officers, it is possible that my account may
not in every particular be correct, but I will be as
exact as I can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, then, for the dress of the life-guards.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The officers of the <i>life-guards</i>, when in full
dress, wear a scarlet coat, single-breasted, which
has a blue velvet Prussian collar, embroidered,
and a bear-skin cap, fourteen inches deep in front,
with white swan feathers. So you see that British
officers may <i>show the white feather</i> without
being suspected of <i>cowardice</i>. Their pantaloons
are of white leather; their swords have half-basket
steel-pierced hilts, with steel scabbards,
and crimson and gold sword-knots, and their
gloves are white leather gauntlets. When in
their undress, they wear blue pantaloons, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>blue cloth forage-cap. The shabraque, or horse-cloth,
of the life-guards is blue, trimmed with lace
and embroidered. An officer’s uniform is often of
great value; but though to lose his <i>full-dress</i> would
be a misfortune, to be <i>stript</i> of his honour would
be a greater loss. Directly after the battle of
Waterloo his royal highness the Prince of Wales,
the Prince Regent, afterward George IV. declared
himself colonel-in-chief of the household
cavalry brigade. This was done as a mark of attention
to the first and second regiments of life-guards,
and the royal horse-guards (blue), who
had conducted themselves very bravely in the
battle. When the Prince Regent became King
he still held the appointment, and William IV.
afterwards followed his example.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The life-guards must appear grand enough
mounted on their fine horses. Now for the horse-guards,
for they come next.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The life-guards do, as you say, appear grand,
but there is many a foot-soldier with his coarse,
grey great-coat, and knapsack on his back, ay,
and many a common sailor, in his plain blue jacket,
that carries as brave a heart in his bosom as a life-guardsman.
In the royal regiment of <i>horse-guards</i>
the officers wear a blue coat with embroidered
scarlet collar. Many parts of their dress resemble
that of the life-guards, but their feathers are
red, and their waist-belt white silk; their horse-furniture
is scarlet with gold-lace and embroidery.”</p>

embroidery, scarlet, and gold lace!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The officers of the <i>dragoon-guards</i> and heavy
dragoons wear a scarlet coat with collar, cuffs, and
turn-backs of regimental facings, and embroidered
skirt-ornaments, and helmets of gilt-metal, with
bear-skin crest. Their trousers are blue, and gold
lace. Their horse-furniture is a high-mounting
saddle, black sheep-skin shabraque edged with scarlet
cloth, with dress housing of blue cloth and gold
lace, a bear-skin flounce, and white web collar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gilt helmets! How they must glitter in the
sun!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They do. A double-breasted scarlet jacket,
with gold basket braid, is worn by the officers of
the <i>light dragoons</i>, if it be not already changed for
a blue one. Their chaco, or cap, is black beaver,
with white drooping cock-tail feathers, trousers
dark blue and gold lace, girdle and waist-belt gold
lace. Their horse-furniture is embroidered blue
cloth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why are dragoons called light and heavy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The heavy dragoons are larger men, and have
heavier and stronger horses. Light troops are the
most nimble, and heavy the most powerful. The
<i>lancers</i>, like the light dragoons, wear a double-breasted
scarlet jacket; the cuff and collar are blue,
and the button-holes embroidered; the cap-plume
is a black cockade, their waist-belt and pouch-belt
are of gold lace, and the pouch-box scarlet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>leather; their shabraque is of blue cloth embroidered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The lancers wear scarlet jackets, but the life-guards
wear scarlet coats; we remember that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The clothing of Prince Albert’s hussars, I
believe, is, blue dress jacket, pelisse all blue, with
fur cuffs and collars; trousers, crimson with yellow
stripes; undress jackets, blue; the hurby, or fur-cap,
of seal-skin; the horse covered with a crimson
shabraque, ornamented with German silver. On
arrival of Prince Albert in England a squadron
of the hussars escorted him from Canterbury to
Sittingbourne. The band played on that occasion
in front of the fountain at Canterbury, when his
royal highness presented them with ten pounds.
From the circumstance of this being the first regiment
which received him on the English shores,
and of his royal highness being struck with their
fine appearance, Prince Albert, it is thought, selected
it as his own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would it not be better if soldiers were clad
in armour, as the knights used to be in old times.
Nothing then could hurt them, unless it was a
cannon ball?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It has been discovered that <i>inside</i> armour is
better than <i>outside</i>. The <i>courage of the heart</i> is
a stronger defence than the <i>breastplate</i>, and the
<i>skill and strength of the arm</i> affords more security
than a <i>helmet of iron</i>.  Philip de Comines tells us
of a number of armed Italian knights, who at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>battle of Fournoue, being overthrown, were unable
to rise on account of the weight of their armour;
they were therefore taken prisoners, but they could
not be killed until they were broken up like huge
lobsters, with wood-cutters’ axes, by the servants
and followers of the army.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dreadful! dreadful!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“James I. when speaking of armour, said, ‘that
it not only protected the wearer from injury but
also prevented him from doing injury to others.’
The following anecdote is told of George IV.
After the battle of Waterloo, it was proposed to
make some change in the dress of the life-guards.
The King ordered one of the soldiers to be sent
for, who was said to have slain in single combat
six or seven French cuirassiers. He was asked
a variety of questions, that his opinion might be
obtained as to what kind of defence or dress was
best for a soldier; but the King saw, by his answers,
that he was overawed, and biassed in his opinion
by the presence of the King, and also of his own
officers, for he assented to everything. At last
the King said to him, ‘Well, if you were going
to have such another day’s work as you had at
Waterloo, how would you like to be dressed?’
‘Why, please your Majesty, in that case, I had
rather be in my shirt-sleeves.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems, that armour would never do for soldiers.
What is the full uniform of the infantry
officers?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“I have told you so much of the dress of the
cavalry that I can only say very little of the infantry.
The officers of the foot-guards wear a
scarlet coat, with blue Prussian collar embroidered
with gold, blue trousers, gold epaulettes, and bear-skin
cap. The infantry of the line wear scarlet
coatees, trousers of Oxford-mixture cloth, or
white linen, with black beaver caps and white
feather; and the light-infantry are dressed much
the same, but their forage-cap is of dark green
cloth, with an embroidered bugle in front.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! the bugle in front of the cap is just right
for the light infantry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The light infantry are an active set of fellows,
here, there, and everywhere at the shortest intervals
of time. The fusiliers’ dress differs little from
that of the infantry of the line, but their cap is
bear-skin, with a white hackle feather. The Highland
regiments wear a scarlet jacket, belted plaid,
kilt, shoes and buckles, with a cocked bonnet,
carrying six black ostrich feathers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The dress of the Highlander is the oddest of
all!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Highlanders are famous with the broadsword.
Perhaps you may remember Sir Walter
Scott’s description of the fight between Fitz James
and Roderick Dhu.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a desperate battle it must have been!
Have you told us all about uniforms?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I think that you have had quite enough
of dress, I will, therefore, only say, that the rifle
regiments wear green jackets and trousers, with a
black beaver cap. The duty of the rifle-corps is
different from that of other soldiers, for they hide
themselves behind the trees, or lie along on the
ground, or among the bushes, so as to be able to
pick off the officers of the enemy with their rifles.
Their dress is green, that they may not be spied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>out so easily. A rifleman will fire off his piece in
almost any attitude, and bring down his enemy.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_b_076.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“What, do they pick off the officers one by
one, just as a sportsman does his birds?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They do, boys! Many practices in war will
hardly do to dwell upon. I have not said so
much about the uniform of sailors as of the uniform
of soldiers; but I will give you a droll account
of the scrape that a boatswain once got into
on account of his love of finery. I think the account
is given by Captain Hall, but I am not
certain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us hear it! Let us hear it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remember once, on the beach of Madras,
witnessing an amusing scene between Sir Samuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Hood, then commander-in-chief in India, and the
newly-promoted boatswain of a sloop-of-war, belonging
to the squadron. The admiral, who was
one of the bravest, and kindest, and truest-hearted
seamen that ever trod a ship’s decks, was a sworn
foe to all trickery in dress-work. The eye of the
veteran officer was directed earnestly towards the
yeast of waves, which, in immense double rows of
surf, fringe and guard the whole of that flat shore.
He felt more anxious than usual about the fate of
this particular boat, from having ordered on shore
the person alluded to, with whom he wished to
have some conversation previously to their parting
company. This boatswain was a young man, who
had been for some years a follower of the admiral,
in different ships, and to whom he had just given
a warrant. The poor fellow, unexpectedly promoted
from before the mast to the rank of an
officer, was trigged up in his newly bought but
marvellously ill-cut uniform, shining like a dollar,
and making its wearer, who, for the first time in
his life, had put on a long coat, feel not a little
awkward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As soon as the boat was partly driven up the
beach by the surf, and partly dragged beyond the
dash of the breakers by the crowd on shore, this
happiest of warrant-officers leaped out on the sand,
and seeing the admiral above him, standing on the
crest of the natural glacis, which lines the shore,
he took off his hat, smoothed down the hair on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>forehead, sailor-fashion, and stood uncovered, in
spite of the roasting sun flaming in the zenith.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The admiral, of course, made a motion with
his hand for the boatswain to put his hat on, but
the other, not perceiving the signal, stood stock
still.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I say, put on your hat!’ called the commander-in-chief,
in a tone which made the newly-created
warrant start. In his agitation he shook
a bunch of well trimmed ringlets a little on one
side, and betrayed, to the flashing eyes of the admiral,
a pair of small, round, silver ear-rings, the
parting gift, doubtless, of some favoured and
favouring ‘Poll’ or ‘Bess,’ of dear, old blackguard
Point Beach, the very ninth heaven of all lighthearted
sailors. Be this as it may, the admiral,
first stepping on one side, and then holding his
head forward, as if to re-establish the doubting
evidence of his horrified senses, and forcibly keeping
down the astonished seaman’s hat with his
hand, roared out,</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Who are you?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘John Marline, sir!’ replied the bewildered
boatswain, beginning to suspect the scrape he had
got himself into.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Oh!’ cried the flag-officer, with a scornful
laugh. ‘Oh! I beg your pardon; I took you for
a Portuguese.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘No, sir!’ instinctively faltered out the other,
seeing the admiral expected some reply.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“‘No? Then if you are not a foreigner, why
do you hoist false colours? What business has an
English sailor with these trumpery machines in
his ears?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I don’t know, sir,’ said poor Marline. ‘I
put them in only this morning, when I rigged
myself in my new togs, to answer the signal on
shore.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Then,’ said Sir Samuel, softened by the contrite
look of his old shipmate, and having got rid
of the greater portion of his bile by the first explosion,
‘you will now proceed to unrig yourself
of this top hamper as fast as you can; pitch them
into the surf, if you like, but never, as you respect
the warrant in your pocket, let me see you in that
disguise again.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you tell us something about the artillery,
uncle? There must be a great many pieces of cannon
used in an army?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are; and if you never know more about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>them than the information you get from me, so
much the better; better to hear of them than to
be among them. I will say a little about the weapons
of war generally, but can only glance at the
subject: it would take me a week to tell you everything,
if I had it all at the tip of my tongue.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, so that your account is not too short,
we must be satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As the world turns round, the weapons in use
among soldiers and sailors and the customs of warfare
change.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When the twang of the bow is heard no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then muskets rattle and cannons roar.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I need not dwell on the clubs, the spears, the bills,
and battle-axes of former times; the slings, the
bows and arrows, the cross-bows and the maces,
that were accustomed to deal death around, are
unknown to modern warfare, nor are the scythe-armed
chariot, the battering-ram, the balista, or
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">catapulta</span>, now ever used in the sea or land
service of Old England.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! gunpowder has put them all aside.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Artillery does not mean cannon only, but all
the huge weapons, apparatus, and stores used in
the field, or in garrisons and sieges. A train of
artillery comprehends cannon, mortars, and howitzers
of all kinds, properly mounted; with horses,
carriages, mortar-beds, block-carriages, ammunition-waggons,
stores, shells, shot, bullets, powder,
and cartridges.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“What a deal of room a train of artillery must
take up!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed it does, for beside what I have told
you, it includes artificers’ tools, intrenching tools,
and miners’ tools, with forges, capstans and gins,
pontoons, pontoon-carriages, tumbrels, chevaux-de-frise,
palisades, drag-ropes, platforms, harness,
flints, powder-measures, fuze-engines, and tents,
to say nothing of a hundred other things that I
cannot remember.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is meant by chevaux-de-frise?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Chevaux-de-frise are pieces of timber, about
ten or a dozen feet long, stuck all over with
wooden pins, six feet long, shod with iron.
They are used to stop up a breach, or a pass,
or to secure a camp, and are sometimes rolled
down on the enemy in an assault. The sword,
the musket, the pike, and the bayonet, the cannon,
the howitzer, and the mortar, with granades,
rockets, and shells, are the principal weapons
of our present wars. There are some who
still entertain the opinion that bows and arrows
in English hands have been more destructive than
muskets bristling with bayonets, and this seems to
me to be very like the truth. The difference between
the long-bow and the cross-bow, is this: the
long-bow is only a bow and string, and its force
depends on the power of the arm that draws it.
The cross-bow, is a bow fastened on a stock, so
that when it is once drawn ready to be let off, it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the same power whether let off by a strong man
or a weak one.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_b_083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Why, boys shoot with bows and arrows.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They do, but they must be men to draw an
arrow to the head on the string of the long-bow
of old times. Topham, one of the strongest men
ever known, laughed to scorn an old archer, who
boasted that he could draw a cloth-yard arrow
to the head on the long-bow. Topham tried to
do this, but could only half draw it, while the
old archer, taking up the bow, performed the feat
adroitly. But a word as to the power of the
bow. A military man of experience says, ‘The
accuracy and range of the arrow fully equalled the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>present most perfect practice of the rifle, and it
greatly exceeded it with respect to rapidity of discharge.’
In the early part of the reign of Henry
VIII. it was still the opprobrium of an archer if he
shot a single shaft during a battle without killing or
disabling his enemy. Some have compared this
with Marshal Saxe’s calculations upon the efficacy
of the musket. Marshal Saxe estimated that in
no case did more than one ball in eighty-five take
effect, and that at the battle of Tournay, not more
than one half in four hundred was calculated to
have killed an enemy; it must be left to military
men to say whether the lead ‘shot from the deadly
level of a gun,’ has been made more deadly
since the tactics of Marshal Saxe. The disuse of
the long-bow is hardly to be accounted for. An
archer was deemed disqualified for service if he
could not fire twelve unerring shafts in one minute.
This, if we take the accuracy of their fire,
for we must be allowed the term, into consideration,
will make the practice of musketry very
inferior.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think bows and arrows will ever be
used again by soldiers?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think not, for the archer is not so well provided
for close fighting as he who carries a musket:
the ball on the inside, and the bayonet on
the out, render the musket a most formidable
weapon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How dreadful it must be to charge with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>bayonet! but, indeed, the sword must be dreadful
too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As I have undertaken to answer your questions,
and to tell you about war and warlike weapons,
I suppose that you must know all that I
happen to remember. About a dozen years ago
Captain Von Selmnitz projected a new mode of
employing the bayonet, and afterwards paid such
attention to it that it became very popular; and
many officers in the service of other countries resorted
to Dresden to study under him. It was
thought by many, that under this system a single
foot soldier, of common strength and of moderately
good eye and limb, would be able to resist two
horsemen. It was the dexterous use made of the
cudgel among the common people in Brittany and
Normandy, that led Selmnitz to reflect on the
matter, and to apply it to the bayonet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which is the worst, the bayonet or the sword?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a difference of opinion respecting
swords and bayonets as weapons of destruction,
or, in other words, between the power of infantry
armed with swords, and infantry armed
with muskets and bayonets. An officer describes
the bayonet as a rickety, zigzag, unhandy
instrument, and says that, ‘at Preston-Pans
two thousand highlanders, armed only with
broad-swords and targets, overthrew, at the very
first onset, nearly two thousand British infantry,
and completed their defeat in about a quarter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>an hour. The same was the case at Falkirk, and
even at Culloden: every point of the line that the
highlanders reached in their charge was completely
overthrown! The destruction made by musketry
is certainly not so great as we might expect from
so formidable a weapon.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One would think that almost every bullet
would kill a man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is not the case by a great deal, as you shall
hear. The same officer goes on to reason the matter
thus: ‘Supposing that twenty thousand French
were killed and wounded at Waterloo, and allowing
five thousand of these to have fallen by the
fire of the artillery and the sabres of the cavalry,
it leaves fifteen thousand to the share of the infantry;
and counting the latter at thirty thousand
only, though the number present was certainly
greater, it required an entire day’s hard fighting
before the thirty thousand had disabled fifteen
thousand adversaries; that is, all the exertions of
two men, during an entire day, only brought down
one enemy! We must not here think of two
fencers, who by equal skill and courage foil each
other’s exertions. There is no such thing as parrying
a musket-ball when properly aimed, nor is
there any defensive power in modern armies beyond
what they derive from their offensive strength;
for with modern arms all fighting is purely offensive.
The above estimate of the efficiency of modern
tactics may, indeed, be considered as highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>overrated, because it applies only to the most sanguinary
battles fought during the war, such as that
of Marengo, Talavera, Boradino, and others, but
by no means to actions of minor note: at Rolica
only a few hundred French were put hors-de-combat,
and at Vimiera sixteen thousand British
only killed and wounded two thousand French,
in what was called a smart action.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is, however, maintained by others, to be
impossible for the sword to contend generally with
success against the musket and bayonet, for that
the latter, to say nothing of the advantage of the
fire, are more than a match for the sword in themselves;
but this is a subject that we had better
leave. My own opinion is, from what I have seen,
that soldiers armed with swords alone would on
very few occasions wait the issue of a charge of
fixed bayonets. May the sword never be drawn
in a bad cause, and the bayonet never be used as
an instrument of oppression.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which are the strongest, cavalry or infantry?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That depends much on circumstances. I remember
no instance at the battle of Waterloo of
the French cuirassiers—certainly some of the
bravest and best cavalry in the world—breaking
the British squares, though cavalry may, in other
instances, have had the advantage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, there must be no end to the guns and
swords required by an army, hundreds of thousands
must be wanted.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Within one year from the beginning of the
war in Spain against the French, England sent
over to the Spanish armies, money to the amount
of two million pounds; a hundred and fifty pieces
of field-artillery, forty-two thousand rounds of ammunition,
two hundred thousand muskets, sixty-one
thousand swords, seventy-nine thousand pikes,
twenty-three million ball-cartridges, six million
loaded balls, fifteen thousand barrels of gunpowder,
ninety-two thousand suits of clothing, three hundred
and fifty six thousand sets of accoutrements
and pouches, three hundred and ten thousand pairs
of shoes, forty tents, two hundred and fifty thousand
yards of cloth, ten thousand sets of camp-equipage,
a hundred and eighteen thousand yards
of linen, fifty thousand great coats, fifty thousand
canteens, fifty thousand <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">havresacs</span>, and a great
variety of other stores.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If England sent two hundred thousand muskets
over to Spain and thousands of barrels of
gunpowder, what a many muskets must have been
used in all! and what a deal of powder!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From 1803 to 1816 England put in circulation
more than three million muskets, without reckoning
those sent out of the country on private
accounts. Eighty thousand barrels of gunpowder
were used up every year; but after 1812, to the
conclusion of peace, more than three times this
quantity of powder was used. If you want to see
field-pieces and stores, you must go to Woolwich,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and there you will see enough. Cannon are cast
solid, and bored out after. James II. of Scotland,
in the year 1460, led on an army to besiege Roxburgh,
and being more curious than wise, he stood
near the gunners, when a cannon, not properly
made, burst and broke his thigh-bone—he died
immediately.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! that was a sad accident; but he should
have kept at a greater distance. It must take a
long time to make a cannon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you in how short a time Buonaparte
provided himself with cannon, after losing all that
he had taken with him to the campaign in Russia,
for I have an account of it here in print, and will
read it:—‘At the period of the disastrous campaign
of Moscow Colonel Evain was at Paris, where
he had been directed to remain, in order to organize
and forward the immense supplies of artillery and
ordnance stores, that were required for the grand
army.’ The celebrated 29th bulletin, from Smorgonj,
had scarcely reached Paris, and had been
made public but a few hours, when a messenger
from the Tuileries came to Colonel Evain’s officer,
and, to his utter surprise, informed him the Emperor
had just arrived, and forthwith demanded his presence
at the Tuileries. Though thunderstruck at
the unexpected intelligence, which at once demonstrated
the terrible misfortunes of the French army,
Evain hastened to the palace, and was instantly
ushered into the presence of his imperial master,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>whom he found in his travelling dress, pale, fatigued,
with a beard of several days’ growth, and
in an evident state of great mental suffering. He
had scarcely time to make his bow or utter a word,
ere Napoleon advanced towards him, and abruptly
exclaimed, ‘Well, Evain! you have read my 29th
bulletin; it does not tell the worst; it would have
been impossible to have alarmed France. We
have not a gun or a caisson remaining! But our
resources are immense—our losses can be repaired.’
Then, after a pause, he added—‘By the first of
March I must have six hundred pieces of cannon,
horsed and equipped. I know your zeal and activity;
you know I must be obeyed.’ Then approaching
close to Evain, Napoleon took hold of
his arm, and with a smile, added—‘If I have my
guns on the appointed day you shall receive the
brevet of Major-general; if not, I will hang you.’
Without being disconcerted, Colonel Evain replied:
‘Sire, the time is limited, but our arsenals
are well-stored. If your majesty will inform me
where I can procure money to purchase horses,
your orders shall be obeyed.’—‘Is that the only
difficulty?’ rejoined the Emperor. Then, sitting
down to his bureau, he wrote an order for three
millions of francs on his private treasury, the contents
of which were in the vaults beneath the
Tuileries—and Evain took his leave. On the 1st
of March, Evain kept his word, and the Emperor
fulfilled his promise.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“Both Buonaparte and Colonel Evain must have
been in right earnest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is very true; and Buonaparte was not a
man to be trifled with. If you should ever go to
the Tower of London you will see weapons of war
in abundance, though very many were destroyed
by the late great fire on the premises. Among
the stores were, a wooden cannon called ‘Policy,’
used at the siege of Bologne to induce the governor
to suppose that the English were well supplied
with artillery; a brass twenty-four pounder, from
the wreck of the Royal George, having lain under
water fifty-two years; a fine brass twenty-four
pounder, bearing a Persian inscription; and a sixty-eight
pounder, of brass, called the ‘Great Harry.’
Whether all, or any of these were destroyed, I cannot
tell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A wooden cannon must be an odd kind of
thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is in St. James’s Park, London, a mortar
that is worth going a long way to see. This mortar
is a beautiful specimen of workmanship, surrounded
with pikes, intersecting each other, and forming a
barrier which protects it from injury on the part
of the public. The mortar bears the following
inscription.</p>

<p>‘TO COMMEMORATE<br /><br />The raising of the siege of Cadiz, in consequence of the glorious victory gained by the Duke of Wellington over the French, near Salamanca, on the 22nd July, 1812. This mortar, cast for the destruction of that great fort, with powers surpassing all others, and abandoned by the besiegers on their retreat, was presented, as a token of respect and gratitude, by the Spanish Nation, to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent.’</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“I might tell you of Perkins’s steam-gun, of
Shrapnel’s shells, of Congreve’s rockets, and of
Cochrane’s bomb-cannon, but I want to speak of
<i>a new power</i>, that is more destructive than all
these put together.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“What can that be, uncle? Why, it must be
wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was on Saturday, the 20th of February,
1841, that Sir Robert Peel, Sir George Murray,
Sir Henry Hardinge, Sir Francis Burdett, Lord
Ingestre, Colonel Gurwood, Captain Britten,
Captain Webster, and others, met together to
witness an experiment about to be tried. A boat,
twenty-three feet long and seven broad, had been
placed on a sheet of water, in the grounds of Mr.
Boyd, in Essex, a few miles only from London.
The boat had been filled up with solid timber,
four and a half feet deep, crossed every way, and
clamped together as closely as possible, with
eight-inch spike nails, so that it was almost as
firm as a solid tree. The boat was set in motion,
and then struck by the new power just abaft her
starboard-bow. The effect was terrible. The water
parted and appeared like a huge bowl, with lightning
playing on its surface. The boat was scattered
into a thousand pieces. A column of water,
resembling a huge fountain, threw the fragments
of the boat some hundred feet into the air, and
many of these fell at a distance of two or three
hundred yards.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a dreadful explosion!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dreadful indeed, boys! The eight-inch spike
nails that I spoke of, were snapped in pieces like
so many carrots, and the mast of the boat resembled
a tree riven by the lightning. The boat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>weighed perhaps two tons and a half, and the
timber in her five tons and a half more; the
weight of water displaced by the explosion could
hardly be less than fourteen or fifteen tons, and
yet the instrument of destruction that effected
all this mischief was only eighteen pounds in
weight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, was it gunpowder!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That I cannot tell. Fearful as it was when
exploded, it was harmless enough before, for one of
the captains kicked it about like a foot-ball. The
inventor said that he could carry enough on a
single mule to destroy the strongest fortress in
Europe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Terrible! Terrible! Why, it would destroy
a ship directly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. A small craft with this power on board
would tear to pieces the largest ship that ever was
built. Muskets, cannon, bombshells, rockets, and
explosions of every kind are not to be compared to
it; and, most likely, should it ever come into general
use, it will make a complete change in naval
and military tactics all over the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will now say a little about a ship, without
dwelling long on the subject. It must be, touch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and go, aloft and below, for young people must
learn to be sometimes satisfied with little.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The more you tell us the better; we like a
long account much better than a short one. Tell
us all that you can think of about a ship and about
sailors too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, that will not suit me just now; my account
must be short. Sailors are sometimes hard to
manage; and it becomes necessary to be quick in
finding out when any ill-will is spreading among
them, for it might lead on to a mutiny. Soldiers
and sailors should be obedient as well as brave—a
<i>red</i>-coat should never be found in the <i>black</i> hole,
nor a <i>blue</i>-jacket show a <i>white</i> feather in the hour
of danger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A mutiny is a sad thing among sailors or
soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is; but I think sailors can be managed
more easily than soldiers, because they usually
go to sea early; whereas soldiers are often men
before they enlist, with all the strength of
their passions about them. A French newspaper
says—‘There is a private in the first
regiment of cuirassiers in the French service,
whom nothing can withstand when he becomes
enraged; in that state he breaks iron like so
much glass, and makes a plaything of a horse,
as if it were a child’s toy. In July last, his lieutenant,
having directed him to take charge of the
fresh horses, Memuel complained of partiality, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>was placed under arrest for four days. He went
quietly to prison; but the door had been scarcely
locked upon him before he fairly shivered it open
without drawing the bolts back, and got away.
He was then thrown into the regimental prison;
from this he speedily broke loose, destroying all
the camp bedsteads, snapping the window-bars
asunder, and scattering the walls and doors in
every direction. After this second release from
‘durance vile’ he was next incarcerated in a dungeon;
but he had crippled his hands and fingers
so much by his last exploit as to be disabled
from <i>active service</i>—in the matter at least of any
fresh <i>escapade</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Terrible! terrible! You never heard of such
a sad fellow as that among sailors, did you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can hardly tell at the moment. Fall in with
the humour of sailors, and they are a good-tempered,
honest-hearted set of fellows. A true-hearted
sailor loves his country, never forsakes a messmate
in danger or trouble, and would rather snap his
cable than break his word. I will tell you a
laughable account that I have just read about a
sailor paying his debts. The account is this:—‘I
ought to add, for the honour of Jack, that the
bumboat-women, landladies, and all others who
had trusted him, were duly remunerated before
the remainder of his money was spent. Many of
these creditors had come round from Chatham for
this purpose. I believe there was but one exception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to their being all honestly and liberally paid.
There was one fellow who made an objection to
his account in rather a Joe Miller sort of style.
I am not sure whether Joe was before him, but
he certainly stuck to his point with the gravity
of an original: this was a Dutchman, who had
entered for our service. Having built rather largely
upon his anticipated pay, he had made his visits
to the bumboat-woman rather often; so that, besides
the score for loaves of bread, red-herrings,
sausages, and <i>pounds of sugar</i>, there appeared
upon his account a considerable number of <i>dittos</i>.
Now, he acknowledged to all the above-named
articles, and paid for them fairly, but he declared
most forcibly that he had never had any dittos,
nor could he be brought to understand what the
word meant by all the logic of the bumboat-woman,
or those who advocated her cause.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Jack did not know what ditto meant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, now let us go on board ship together.
I will tell you something that will a little surprise
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it? what is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the opinion of an officer, as brave and
as well-informed as any in the British navy, that
it is an excellent thing to have on board ship a
monkey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A monkey! Why, he would be so full of his
antics as to set the blue-jackets laughing at him;
and then, he would be always in mischief.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“For these very reasons Captain Hall recommends
that Mr. Pug should be received as one
of the crew. He well knows the advantage of
light hearts and good humour on board ship, and
thinks that few things are more likely to afford
mirth to the blue-jackets than the comical tricks
of a monkey! If Mr. Pug cannot be taught to
weigh anchor, reef a sail, or pull a rope, he can
grin and chatter at those who do these things, and
thereby keep them in a good temper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good, Mr. Pug; and now, while you run
up the ropes we shall, perhaps, hear something
more about ships.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have a few pictures of ships, which I will
show you. See! here is a ship in the time of
King Alfred.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_099.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Is that a ship? Why, there seems to be no
room for the sailors.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“You must remember, that in the time of
Alfred, Jack-tars were not so plentiful as they
are now. But, perhaps, a ship in the reign of
William the Conqueror will please you better.
What do you think of this? It has, you see, a
kind of house, or tower, upon it. This would prevent
the men on board from being so much exposed
as in the other ship: a thing of no trifling
importance in a time of warfare. A well-built and
well manned British ship of war, such as carries
an admiral’s flag now, would, no doubt, destroy
a whole fleet of the ships of olden time. Half-a-dozen
broadsides would send as many ships of
William the Conqueror’s days to the bottom. But
what do you think of this ship?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_100.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Why, that is very little better than the
other. It has but one mast and one sail, and
nothing like a sailor is to be seen.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“Come, I must try again, it seems. Here is a
ship in the time of Henry III. Will that suit
you? You cannot say that has but one mast.
The shrouds, too, that hold the masts steady, are
here fastened to the sides of the vessel. It was
not so before. This method of steadying the masts
is a decided improvement, you must admit, though
the vessel is still far from being perfect.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_101.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, there is no doubt of its being an improvement,
to say nothing of the flags flying at the top;
but such a vessel would not do at the present time.
It has two masts certainly, but it is but an odd-looking
ship, after all. What is the next picture
you have, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“It is a ship of the reign of Edward IV. Ships
then had four masts, with a sail to each of them,
as well as a forecastle at the head, and a cabin at
the stern. Like all other things of importance,
ships have been brought to perfection by degrees.
Whether I am right in supposing a British man-of-war
to be perfect, even now, is a question.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_102.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! this is much grander than the others,—but
every man on the deck has a long spear in his
hand. That is not very sailor-like, is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why no, it is not boys; at least, not like the
sailors of the present day. This ship of the reign
of Henry VIII. will please you.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
<img src='images/i_b_103.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“That is something like! Plenty of masts, and
sails, and cannon too, in that ship; and what a
height the hull runs up! Please to tell us something
about a first-rate man-of-war, such as are
now in the British navy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now then for a man-of-war. If you are ready
for a dive, we will go under water together. We
will begin at the false keel; this is made fast under
the keel to preserve it from injury in case of a run
upon the rocks. On the keel is the keelson to
strengthen it. The timbers that start out right
and left from the keel are the ribs, and the planking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>is fastened to them inside and out. You know
the head from the stern, I dare say.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A bold British sailor his duty should learn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And know every rope from the head to the stern;</div>
      <div class='line'>His heart should be firm when the rude billows roll,</div>
      <div class='line'>And as true as the needle that points to the pole.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! that is a good description of a sailor; he
should know his duty, and carry a true heart in
his bosom.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To say nothing of the forecastle and quarter-decks,
a first-rate has three whole decks. Under
the lower gun-deck is the orlop-deck, where you
will find the store-rooms of the carpenter, the gunner,
the boatswain, the surgeon, and the purser, as
well as the cockpit, which is near the after-hatchway.
Over the lower gun-deck is the middle deck,
and over that the upper or main-deck. Above
these are the forecastle and quarter-deck.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A first-rate, then, has three decks, besides the
forecastle and quarter-deck and orlop-decks; and
how many masts?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To carry the yards, sails and rigging, there
are three masts, and each has three parts, so that
we have the main-mast, the main-top mast, and
the main-top-gallant mast; the fore-mast, the fore-top
mast, and the fore-top-gallant mast; the mizen-mast,
the mizen-top mast, and the mizen-top-gallant
mast. Besides these, there is sometimes a small
mast, still higher up, called the royal; so that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>are main-top-gallant royal, fore-top-gallant royal,
and mizen-top-gallant royal masts; the bowsprit
runs out over the head of the ship: it may be called
a mast or a boom. In books sailors are often
named after the different parts of a ship; and thus
we have ‘Tom Starboards,’ ‘Ben Braces,’ and
‘Mat Mizens,’ in abundance. No doubt you have
heard the following words sung:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The darling of our crew;</div>
      <div class='line'>No more he’ll hear the tempest howling,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For death has broached him to.</div>
      <div class='line'>His form was of the manliest beauty,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His heart was kind and soft,</div>
      <div class='line'>Faithful, below he did his duty,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And now he’s gone aloft.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! yes! Tom Bowling is a favourite song.
Now tell us about the sails of a ship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The principal sails are, the courses, or lower
sails; the top-sails, the top-gallant sails, and the
top-gallant-royal sails. When there is a sail higher
than these it is called a sky-scraper. You know,
I dare say, that the rope part of a ship is called
the rigging, but if you know the names of half the
ropes, blocks, and tackling, you are wiser than I
take you to be. The lower rigging of a ship consists
of the shrouds, and the stays, that keep the
lower masts in their places; the standing rigging
is fixed, and the running rigging moves in altering
the sails and the yards.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“What a pity that a ship should ever be
wrecked.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A pity indeed; and a capital thing it is, when
a wreck does take place, if a life-boat is at hand.
A life-boat is so constructed that it will live among
breakers that would swamp a common ship’s boat
directly. Many a brave red-coat and blue-jacket
has been saved by the life-boat.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>She has stemm’d them before, and she’ll stem them again.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“The life-boat must be a capital thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is; but every vessel that sails on the seas
is adapted to the service which it is to perform:
the man-of-war, the frigate and the privateer are
to carry, in their capacious hulls, the lightning and
thunder of war; the smaller craft, such as cutters,
schooners, and gun-boats, are to attend on fleets
and supply the wants of larger vessels; and the
life-boat is to rescue from destruction the shipwrecked
crew and drowning mariner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why is it that the anchor does not keep the
ship from being blown on the rocks, and wrecked?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because anchors and cables are, like everything
else, apt to break when tried beyond their
strength. Now and then, when the wind blows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>hard, you find that the string of your kite breaks,
and so it is with a cable; thick and strong as it
is, it often snaps like a kite-string, when the storm
is abroad in its strength,—man makes the cable,
but God makes the storm; no wonder that the
latter should be the stronger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How thick is a cable? and how heavy is an
anchor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A good sheet-anchor-cable is a hundred and
twenty fathoms, or two hundred and forty yards
long. It is twenty inches round it, at least, and
weighs five or six tons. It is made of almost two
thousand threads, or rope-yarns.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One would think nothing could break it! And
how heavy is the anchor?”</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>

<p class='c011'>“There are different sorts of anchors: bower-anchors,
stream-anchors, and kedge-anchors; and
they are of different
weights; but a best
bower-anchor, or, we
will call it a sheet-anchor,

four and five
tons. It costs as
much as four hundred
pounds.”</p>

of the capstan, a very

timber, having square

it, that its situation may
be known. If this were
not done a ship would
often entangle her cable
by coming too near it.
There are many kinds
of buoys.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All kinds of knotting are also required. But
there would be, absolutely, no end to things of this
sort if I were to attempt
to describe them. There is
a very useful instrument
on board ship besides
the compass, and that
is a quadrant, a mathematical
instrument used
in navigation to take latitudes.
The altitude of
the sun and stars is ascertained by it, as well as the
height and distance of other objects.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a deal must be known on board ship!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Much knowledge is required to make a complete
seaman,—but more on this subject another
time. Before I leave you I will relate a singular
anecdote of an Indian, which I read in the newspapers;
it falls in very well with the subject of
soldiers and sailors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us have it directly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In order to assist the officers of the Indian
department in their arduous duty of persuading
remote tribes to quit their lands, it has been found
advisable to incur the expense of inviting one or
two of their chiefs three thousand or four thousand
miles, to Washington, in order that they should
see with their own eyes, and report to their tribes,
the irresistible power of the nation with whom
they are arguing. This speculation has, it is said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>in all instances, more or less effected its object.
For the reasons and for the object we have stated,
it was deemed advisable that a certain chief should
be invited from his remote country to Washington;
and, accordingly, in due time, he appeared
there. After the troops had been made to manœuvre
before him; after thundering volleys of artillery
had almost deafened him; and after every
department had displayed to him all that was
likely to add to the terror and astonishment he
had already experienced, the President, in lieu
of the Indian’s clothes, presented him with a
colonel’s uniform; in which, and with many other
presents, the bewildered chief took his departure.
In a pair of white kid gloves, tight blue coat,
with gilt buttons, gold epaulettes, and red sash,
cloth trowsers with straps, high-heeled boots,
cocked hat, and scarlet feather, with a cigar in
his mouth, a green umbrella in one hand, and
a yellow fan in the other, and with the neck of
a whiskey-bottle protruding out of each of the
two tail pockets of his regimental coat, this
‘monkey that had seen the world’ suddenly
appeared before the chiefs and warriors of his
tribe; and as he stood before them, straight as
a ramrod, in a high state of perspiration, caused
by the tightness of his finery, while the cool fresh
air of heaven blew over the naked unrestrained
limbs of his spectators, it might, perhaps, not
unjustly, be said of the costumes, ‘Which is the
savage?’ In return for the presents he had received,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and with a desire to impart as much real
information as possible to his tribe, the poor jaded
traveller undertook to deliver to them a course
of lectures; in which he graphically described all
that he had witnessed. For a while he was listened
to with attention; but as soon as the
minds of his audience had received as much as
they could hold, they began to disbelieve him.
Nothing daunted, however, the traveller still
proceeded. He told them about wigwams, in
which a thousand people could at one time pray
to the Great Spirit; of other wigwams, five stories
high, built in lines, facing each other, and
extending over an enormous space; he told them
of war canoes that would hold twelve hundred
warriors. Such tales to the Indian mind seemed
an insult to common sense. For some time
he was treated merely with ridicule and contempt,—but
when resolutely continuing to recount
his adventures, he told them that he had
seen white people who, by attaching a great ball
to a canoe, could rise in it into the clouds, and travel
through the heavens. The Medicine, Mystery,
or learned men of his tribe, pronounced him to be an
impostor; and the multitude vociferously declaring
that he was too great a liar to live, a young warrior,
in a paroxysm of anger, levelled a rifle at his
head, and blew his brains out. A portrait of this
Indian is now to be seen in Mr. Catlin’s gallery of
pictures in London.”</p>

Jack sent aloft.—Captain Hall on naval punishments.—Instance

<p class='c010'>“Now, uncle, you will please to tell us what an
engineer is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An engineer, boys, is one who has a knowledge
of warlike engines, and who directs the attack or
defence of a fortification, building or repairing according
to the circumstances of the case, such works
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>as have been injured by the enemy. It takes a
wise man, and one of quick apprehension, to make a
good engineer; he should have resources always, as
we say, ‘at his finger ends.’ He ought to possess
much practical knowledge, and a readiness and ability
to apply it instantaneously. When Buonaparte
made his attack on Jean D’Acre, the handful
of brave fellows under Sir Sidney Smith never
would have been able to withstand him had they
not been ably assisted by the talents of Phillipeaux,
the engineer. A good engineer will make a weak
place strong; enable a few to withstand many, and
obtain a victory where nothing is expected but
defeat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bravery will never do without knowledge and
skill, it seems.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not, at least, in a case where the attacking
party is so strong as that at the siege of Acre. An
engineer should be well acquainted with mining, or
the art of blowing up rocks and fortifications with
gunpowder, and this he cannot be unless he can
ascertain with correctness the heights, depths,
breadth, and resistance of the materials he has
to displace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a many things are necessary to be
known by soldiers and sailors!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sappers are men who work at the trenches,
or ditches. If a brigade of eight men are employed
at any point of the works, you will see
half of them working away at the sap, or trench,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>while the others are busily occupied in supplying
gabions, fascines, and such other things as may be
wanted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, there is no place safe in time of war,
for what with the cannon and riflemen above
ground, and the miners and sappers below, you
are always in danger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A soldier’s life is a life of danger, and every
one should do his duty; but, for all that, no <i>sapper</i>
should <i>undermine</i> the reputation of his comrades,
and no <i>rifleman</i> should <i>aim</i> at a lower mark than
honour. Gunnery is the art of determining the
motions of bodies, whether they are projected from
cannon, mortars, or howitzers. Without a knowledge
of gunnery an attack or a defence would be
very feeble. The power of well-charged and well-directed
cannon is very great. A good gunner never
sends a ball on an useless errand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the battle between Lord Hawke and the
French, the gallant admiral, finding so much to
depend on the capture of the French admiral’s
ship, the Soleil Royale, desired to be laid alongside
her; but the pilot hesitatingly replied, that
he feared to do so, from the rocky shoals of the
coast off which the battle raged. Hawke, however,
was not to be dissuaded, and bore down
upon her, with every gun double-shotted. The
captain of a French seventy-four gun ship, the
Surveillante, aware of Hawke’s design, gallantly
threw his ship between Hawke and the French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>admiral, in time to receive Lord Hawke’s fire,
which saved the French admiral, but sent the
Surveillante and every soul on board to the
bottom.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, the Surveillante was sent down with
a single broadside?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was. And a well-managed and effective
battery will make a breach in the strongest wall
that ever was built, in a very short time. War
is a dreadful weapon, and it ought never to be
wielded in a bad cause.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What thousands and thousands of Englishmen
must have been killed by gunpowder!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, there have indeed; but soldiers say,
‘every bullet has its billet.’ The English army,
from the time Lord Wellington was appointed
commander in Portugal, to the peace, is supposed
to have sustained the following loss.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This account does not include the Brunswickers,
Hanoverians, Portuguese, nor Spaniards.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“It seems a wonder there were no more killed.
One would expect half the soldiers and sailors that
went into battle would be killed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, that is not the case. At Salamanca there
was one soldier in ninety killed; at Vittoria, one
in seventy-four; and at the battle of Waterloo,
one in forty. At the battle of the Nile there was
one sailor killed in thirty-six; at Trafalgar, one in
forty-one, and at Copenhagen one in thirty-nine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How often do soldiers get leave to go home
and see their friends?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not very often. If they could go when they
liked the ranks would be rather thinner than
they are. A poor widow that I once knew, whose
son was a soldier, expected him home on a furlough—day
after day passed, and he did not come;
at last a soldier entered her dwelling. Seeing the
uniform, the poor woman sprang forwards: alas!
it was not her son, but a comrade who had brought
her the news of his death. The commanding-officer
can grant a furlough, or leave of absence, to
non-commissioned officers and soldiers when he
pleases, and as long as he pleases, but he is not
frequently applied to. If a furlough is obtained
by a soldier from his captain for twenty days,
it will be some time before it comes to his turn
again, for only two men are allowed to be absent
from a troop or company, unless in particular
cases, at the same time. The muster-roll is kept
with great care.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“What is the muster-roll—a list to call over the
names of the soldiers?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you. A muster-roll is a list of the
officers and men in every regiment or company, by
which they are called over, receive their pay, and
are otherwise inspected. When you hear of a
soldier having lost his name on the muster-roll, it
means that he is dead. If an officer makes a false
return, such as allowing the name of a soldier to
stand on the muster-roll as being with his regiment
when he is absent from it, he is liable to be
cashiered, that is, dismissed the service.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would be a very severe punishment to
an officer, but as the men are punished when they
do wrong, the officers ought not to escape.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The men are, as you say, punished when they
do wrong. I wish that punishments could be safely
done away in the army and navy, but when we
consider that the men are principally drawn from
the lowest and most ignorant classes, it would be
too much to expect them to be kept in order if
insubordination were not punished. Punishment,
though it may not make a culprit a better man,
may prevent him from repeating the offence, and
deter others from committing it; still justice should
be tempered with mercy, and I have known cases
wherein clemency has had the happiest effect.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How are officers and men generally punished?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may remember that the Articles of War
point out what punishment is due to a crime,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>though oftentimes it is not inflicted. Officers who
have offended are occasionally put under arrest,
and naval officers are entered at the bottom of the
list of their own rank. Soldiers are imprisoned,
and sometimes flogged, and Poor Jack, instead
of having a rope’s end, is, now and then, sent up
to the main-top, and kept there in a blow till he
is almost hungry enough to gnaw the rigging like
a rat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, poor fellow! he would find nothing else
there to gnaw.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the subject of naval punishments Captain
Hall’s opinion is, ‘that if every captain were
obliged by positive regulation to adopt the following
course, a great diminution in the number of
punishments would ensue, that those which were
inflicted would be less severe, and that the discipline
of the fleet would be essentially improved.
His plan is, to make it imperative on officers in
command to defer specifying what the amount of
any punishment is to be until twenty-four hours
have elapsed after the offence has been inquired
into. He also considers that great practical advantages
would arise from investigating all offences
between the hours of nine in the morning and
noon, a period when all parties are likely to be
free from those exciting causes, which need not
be particularly alluded to, but which do often interfere
with the course of justice when the inquiry
takes place after the men have had their grog,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the officers their dinner, or the captain his claret.
The present regulations of the navy require that
twelve hours should elapse between the inquiry
and the punishment, but this is scarcely enough.
The most salutary check on intemperance of any
kind is a night’s rest, and surely, when so serious
an affair as corporal punishment is in question, it
is not requiring too much of all captains to defer
passing sentence till they have consulted their
pillow at least once.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Captain Hall is very much in the right to say
what he does.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many instances of injustice in hastily awarding
punishment in the navy might be given; the
following is a striking example of the kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two men-of-war happened to be cruising in
company; one of them, a line-of-battle ship, bearing
an admiral’s flag; the other, a small frigate.
One day, when they were sailing quite close to
each other, the signal was made from the large
to the small ship to chase in a particular direction,
implying that a strange sail was seen in that
quarter. The look-out man at the maintop-mast-head
of the frigate was instantly called down by
the captain, and severely punished on the spot, for
not having discovered and reported the stranger
before the flag-ship had made the signal to chase.
The unhappy sufferer, who was a very young
hand, unaccustomed to be aloft, had merely taken
his turn at the mast-head with the rest of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>ship’s company, and could give no explanation of
his apparent neglect. Before it was too late, however,
the officer of the watch ventured to suggest
to the captain, that possibly the difference of height
between the masts of the two ships might have
enabled the look-out man on board the Admiral
to discover the stranger, when it was physically
impossible, owing to the curvature of the earth,
that she could have been seen on board the frigate.
No attention, however, was paid to this remark,
and a punishment due only to crime, or to a manifest
breach of discipline, was inflicted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The very next day the same officer whose
remonstrance had proved so ineffectual, saw the
look-out man at the flag-ship’s mast-head again,
pointing out a strange sail. The frigate chanced
to be placed nearly in the direction indicated;
consequently she must have been somewhat nearer
to the stranger than the line-of-battle ship was.
But the man stationed at the frigate’s mast-head
declared he could distinguish nothing of any
stranger. Upon which the officer of the watch
sent up the captain of the main-top, an experienced
and quick-sighted seaman, who, having for some
minutes looked in vain in every direction, asserted
positively that there was nothing in sight from
that elevation. It was thus rendered certain, or,
at all events, highly probable, that the precipitate
sentence of the day before had been unjust; for,
under circumstances precisely similar, or even less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>favourable, it appeared that the poor fellow could
not by possibility have seen the stranger, for not
first detecting which he was punished!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That hasty captain ought to have been ashamed
of himself. If he had only considered the matter,
the man would not have been punished.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An officer, like a good sword, should be well-tempered,
whether he belong to the army or navy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have never described to us a soldier’s
burial! The funeral of a general must be grand
and solemn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some other time! some other time! When a
soldier, fighting for plunder and empty glory, dies,
he merits little sympathy; but when in a good
cause, and in a battle that cannot be avoided, he
draws his sword, falling on the field not for idle renown
but in the defence of the weak and oppressed,
and for the preservation of his country, then the
words of the poet appear more suitable to him—</p>

would like to hear it, however, I will read to you
what a private soldier says of it in a letter to his
parents.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, let us hear it, if you please. Was he a
horse-soldier?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was in the cavalry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He thus describes an attack made on the
French guards:—‘Our brigade was then formed
into three lines, each regiment composing its own
line, which was the 10th, 18th, and a regiment
of German Legion Hussars; my own regiment
forming the first line. Wellington then came
in front of the line, and spoke in the following
manner:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Tenth,’ says he, ‘you know what you are
going to do, and you know what is expected of
you, and I am well assured it will be done. I
shall, therefore, say no more, only wish you success,’
and with that he gave the order for us to
advance. I am not ashamed to say, that well
knowing what we were going to do, I offered up
a prayer to the Almighty that, for the sake of my
children and the partner of my bosom, he would
protect me, and give me strength and courage to
overcome all that opposed me; and with a firm
mind I went, leaving all that was dear to me to
the mercy of that Great Ruler who has so often,
in the midst of peril and danger, protected me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>After advancing about a hundred yards, we struck
into a charge as fast as our horses would go, keeping
up a loud and continued cheering, and soon we
were among the Imperial Guards of France; the
18th also charging as soon as we got among them,
which so galled them, that we slew and overcame
them like so many children, although they rode in
armour, and carried lances ten feet long; but so
briskly did our lads lay the English steel about
them, that they threw off their armour and pikes,
and those that could get away flew in all directions;
but still we had not done, for there were two great
and solid squares of infantry, who had hurt us much
with their fire whilst we were advancing, and still
continued to do so whilst we were forming again.
In short they were all around us; we therefore
formed as well as we could, and at them we went.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In spite of their fixed bayonets we got into
their columns, and like birds they fell to the ground,
and were thrown into confusion; and it run like
wild-fire among their troops that their guards were
beaten and panic-struck,—they flew in all directions.
But still we had not done our part, and left those
to pursue who had seen the onset. We took sixteen
guns at our charge, and many prisoners, but
we could see no longer, it was so dark; and at
length we assembled what few we had got together
of the regiment, and the general of the brigade
formed us in close column, so that we might all
hear him, and he addressed us in the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>manner:—‘Now, Tenth,’ he said, ‘you have not
disappointed me; you are just what I thought
you were; you were the first regiment that broke
their lines, and to you it is that we are indebted
for turning the fate of the day, and depend upon
it that your Prince shall know it, for nothing but
the bravery and discipline of the regiment could
have completed such a work.’ We then gave him
three cheers, and since that he has given us at a
great length in our orderly books, his thanks and

<p class='c010'>“Well, now I am to describe to you a blockade
and a bombardment, a siege, and a storming
party; but you will understand them better if I
say a word or two first about fortification.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Oh yes! let us know something about fortification
first.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many sad instances of failure and loss have
occurred from a want of knowledge of fortification.
Without knowledge no place of defence is secure;
fortresses require to be defended by strong minds
as well as by strong walls. At the surprise of
Bergen-up-Zoom, in 1814, a body of six hundred
British troops laid down their arms merely because
they had no officer with them who knew enough
of fortification to conduct their retreat by the
covered way. Had such an officer been with them
every man might have safely made his escape.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a pity!—every officer ought to understand
fortification.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If an officer be at home, he can if he pleases
see the fortifications at Dover, Portsmouth, Chatham
and Plymouth; and if abroad, he may have,
perhaps, the opportunity of inspecting the splendid
works at Gibraltar, or Malta, or those in the East
or West Indies, or in our American colonies.
Fortification is the art of strengthening a place, so
that a small number of men can defend it against
the attack of a great number. Whether fortification
was first used as a defence against the strong,
the unjust, the revengeful, and ambitious, or used by
them in furtherance of their designs, might be difficult
to determine. The principal engine brought
to bear against fortified places in ancient times
was the aries, or battering-ram, made mostly of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>brass. This, formed at the end like the head of
a ram, was suspended from a beam, and pushed
violently against the walls by soldiers, who were
hid in a covered carriage on which the battering-ram
rested.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! we have seen a picture of soldiers using
the battering-ram.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Parapets with embrasures, or holes, in them,
through which arrows might be shot, were introduced;
and after them came strong square towers,
erected from each other about a stone’s cast, but
when gunpowder was invented these things were
comparatively useless. Terraces, or ramparts with
parapets, were adopted, as well as bastions. A
bastion is a huge mass of earth, faced either with
sods, brick-work, or stone. It stands out from the
rampart, of which it, indeed, forms a principal part.
What is now called a bastion was in old times
called a bulwark.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have seen the word bulwark in a sea-song—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Britain’s best bulwarks are her wooden walls.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I remember the song. There were also
ravelins, triangular works, projecting outwards;
horn-works; two demi-bastions, joined by a curtin,
and other works. A curtin, or curtain, is that
part of the rampart which lies between the flanks,
or sides, of two bastions; it is bordered with a
parapet or elevation of earth. But perhaps I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>better show you a drawing or two of a fortification,
and then you will see all the parts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The very thing! the very thing!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here is a drawing of the old plan of fortifying
a place when bows and arrows were used, before
gunpowder was found out. You see the tower,
the walls, the ditch, and the battering-ram.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_128.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! we see the battering-ram has been at
work, for the wall is broken sadly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before I show you the two other drawings
I will explain to you that the principal maxims
of fortification are these:—First, that every part
of the works be seen and defended by other parts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>so that the enemy cannot lodge anywhere without
being exposed to the fire of the place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! that must be very necessary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Secondly. A fortress should command all places
round it, and, therefore, all the outworks should be
lower than the body of the place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That seems to be quite as necessary as the
other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thirdly. The works furthest from the centre
should always be open to those that are near.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everything appears to be thought of in fortification.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fourthly. The defence of every part should
always be within the reach of musket-shot, so as to
be defended both by ordnance and small fire-arms.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be a hard matter to take a fortress,
when such pains are taken to make it strong.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fifthly. All the defences should be as nearly
direct as possible, for experience shows that soldiers
are too apt to fire directly before them, whether
they do execution or not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a deal of thought seems necessary!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sixthly. A fortification should be equally
strong on all sides, otherwise by being attacked
in its weakest point its strength will become
useless.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is very plain. A weak part would be
sure to be attacked if it were found out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seventhly. The more acute (sharp) the angle
at the centre is, the stronger will be the place.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“We understand that, because it would throw
off the cannon balls better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And, lastly. In great places dry ditches are
preferable to those filled with water, because sallies,
retreats, succours, etc. are necessary; but in small
fortresses wet ditches that can be drained are the
best, as standing in need of no sallies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, then, you will please to show us the
other drawings of a fortification.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, boys, you shall see them. Here is one;
you may understand it pretty well by looking it
over. The side of the ditch next the rampart is
the escarpe, and the side next the country the
counterscarpe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must look over this by ourselves, and
then we shall make it all out, no doubt; but, now,
will you tell us how so strong a place is to be
taken? We want to know everything belonging
to it, so please to be particular.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will do my best to make you understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>how a fortress is taken. You must remember one
thing, that let a place be ever so strong, when
closely besieged it must gradually get weaker
for want of supplies; whereas the besiegers, having
the country open to them, can get supplies
of men, provisions, and everything else they require.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, that gives them a great advantage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There may be said to be <i>four periods</i> in an attack
on a fortified place; the <i>first</i> includes all the
military arrangements and preparations in the investment
of the place; the <i>second</i> includes the
opening of the trenches, or first parallel; the
<i>third</i> includes the establishment of the second
parallel; and the <i>fourth</i> includes the third parallel,
with all the hazards and toil of seizing the
covered way, of getting across the moat, and of
obtaining possession, one after another, of all the
works of the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean by the investment of the
place?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you. When a fortified place is to
be attacked, it is necessary to surround it with
troops, so as to prevent the place from holding
communication with, or getting supplies from their
allies, or from the neighbouring country. It is
often the case, too, that the besiegers form two
sets of fortified lines, and pitch their camp, for
security, between them. The line that faces the
country is called the line of <i>circumvallation</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the other line, facing the fortified place, is called
that of <i>countervallation</i>; but you will understand
it better by this drawing.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_b_133.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“We begin to understand a little more about it
now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jones, in his ‘Sieges in Spain,’ says: ‘To ensure
the reduction of a fortress, a fully equipped siege
army is absolutely necessary; and any deficiency,
especially in the engineer or artillery departments,
must assuredly involve an unnecessary loss of life;
to save men, science and materials must be brought
into play.’ Vauban’s invaluable maxim should
ever be kept in view, ‘Never attempt anything at
a siege by open force which may be gained by art
and labour.’ In many cases a fortified place may
be taken by investment or blockade alone, for if it
be not well supplied with provisions, and cannot
obtain them, it must of necessity capitulate or
surrender.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“Yes! that is clear enough, or they would all
of them be soon starved to death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well do I remember, when the Duke of
Wellington—he was a Marquis then—blockaded
Pamplona, in Spain. He was about to besiege
the place, but when he and Sir Richard Fletcher
came to reconnoitre, they found that it was too
strong for them; a sufficient number of troops
could not be spared to reduce it, even if they
had had ordnance, stores, and materials sufficient
for the purpose, which they had not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There were a great many soldiers inside the
place, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The garrison was considerable; but besides
that the works were strong, and in good order.
There were at least two hundred pieces of ordnance
ready to play on the besiegers, and the city
was defended on one side by the river, and covered
on the other by the citadel. The siege was
given up, and a blockade established instead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And how was the blockade managed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In a most masterly way. And Wellington gave
a proof how well he could change his tactics when
necessary, and act in the most efficient manner,
according to the circumstances in which he found
himself. He confined the garrison, and strengthened
his own force, by throwing up works round
the place, in the nearest heights, that commanded
all the roads and communications with the enemy.
There were nine redoubts, garrisoned on favourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>points, within one thousand five hundred yards, and
the remaining force was placed under cover in the
villages, or bivouacked out of the range of the fire
of the place. Marshal Soult advanced with a
strong force to relieve the place, and penetrated so
far as to be within a few miles of it; so that there
was every reason to expect an attack from Soult,
and a desperate sortie from the fortress at the
same time, if the latter should be aware that relief
was near at hand. Yet so well did the British
commander provide for the danger, by reinforcing
the advanced posts, pushing out chains of
sentinels, and keeping the whole blockading force
under arms, that not a single communication took
place between the fortress and the troops under
Marshal Soult. Think, boys, for a moment, of the
skill on the part of the commander, and vigilance on
the part of the men, to prevent a strong fortress,
situated close to its own frontier, from holding the
least communication with, or receiving the least
information of their friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And was the place obliged to surrender?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was. Let me now describe a bombardment,
in few words. A town, city, or fortress, is
bombarded by firing bombshells and rockets into
it in order to set fire to it, to blow up the powder
magazines, to knock down the houses, churches,
and other edifices of the place, and to do as much
damage as possible, that the place may be compelled
to surrender.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Why do they fire bombshells, and not common
balls?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cannon shot are fired to batter down walls
and outworks, but bombshells do more damage.
When Mahomet II. besieged Constantinople in
1453 he battered it with huge stones so large
that only four of them could be fired in a day.
You must remember, boys, that bombshells and
rockets are fired in the air, that they may fall
down upon the place attacked, but cannon balls
are fired straight. There is a way, it is true, of
firing cannon, called ricochet-firing. The gun is
loaded with but little powder, and the ball is
thrown just over the parapet of the enemy, that
it may fall into the works, and roll and bounce,
destroying all before it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why does a bombshell do more mischief
than a cannon ball?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because it is filled with combustible matter,
and has a fuse to it, so that after sinking into the
ground, which it does on account of the great
height from which it falls, it bursts to pieces with
great force, tearing up and destroying everything
around it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We understand now. A cannon ball is bad
enough, but a bombshell must be dreadful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As a fuller account of a siege and a storming
party will be given you before I have done, it will
be enough now to say, that to besiege a place is to
encamp an army before it with the design to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>it; and to storm a place is to enter it by force,
breaking through all opposition.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A storming party must be a desperate affair,
and a soldier had need have the heart of a lion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True, boys, a soldier has need of a firm heart
to go through what he has to endure; he is expected
to be <i>cool</i> in the <i>hottest</i> engagement; to <i>fire</i>
steadily though up to his knees in <i>water</i>; and to
<i>stand at ease</i>, when required, under the <i>galling</i>
grape-shot of an enemy’s battery.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We want, uncle, to hear you go on in your
account of soldiers and sailors. Now for a good
long account.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, boys, I will do my best, and describe
them as they are. British soldiers often <i>run</i>, but
very seldom <i>run away</i>; and sailors are more apt
to <i>strike at</i> than to <i>strike to</i> their enemies. I remember
hearing of a captain, whose stories were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>always too long. I am glad that you do not think
so of mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who was he? please to tell us who he was?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen, then, and you shall know all that I
know of him. During the American war, a Captain
S—— used much to annoy his companions in
arms by his unreasonable long stories. Day after
day he was continually imposing on them the tax
of a long story. Being once present at a court-martial
on a soldier, who had a good character,
and who had committed a very slight offence, his
brother officers thought it a good opportunity to
try to correct Captain S—— of his failing. While
then they were deliberating on the sentence about
to be pronounced, a certain major turned to the
president and said, ‘<i>Suppose we sentence him to
hear two of Captain S——’s long stories?</i>’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good! very good! Your stories are
not like his, for they are not long enough. That
captain might be a kind-hearted man, after all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very likely; a kind-hearted disposition will
show itself in every situation in life; and if soldiers
and sailors are called on by the stern duties
of their profession to deal death among the enemies
of their country, yet may they, when the
battle is over, exercise as much humanity as
other people. There is room for mercy to walk
amid the crowded camp, or on the deck of a
battle ship, taking care that no life shall be uselessly
and wantonly sacrificed, and no prisoner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>used with inhumanity. I have seen a soldier,
who would fearlessly have led the forlorn-hope,
weep like a child on hearing of the death of his
father; and I have known as rough a sailor as
ever took in a reef of the mainsail, sob again,
on receiving a letter from his mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Soldiers and sailors have hearts like other
people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope so. They are not brought up in a
school that will allow them to parade their feelings,
but it would be wrong to say, on that account,
that they do not possess them. As an old
soldier myself, I may be apt to advance too much
in their favour. Both in Spain and in India have
I met with instances without number, of kindly
affections on the part of my companions in arms.
Again and again have I, in disastrous circumstances,
found in them warm-hearted sympathy,
and more than once in a retreat have I shared
the last morsel of food of a starving brother
officer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was very kind of them indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will give you one instance of true courage,
intrepidity, and kind-heartedness, that deserves to
be remembered. A town in Spain, defended by
1500 Carlists, was taken by assault, after two
days’ resistance. One house only was still defended
by twenty-five men, who had shut themselves
up there with the family. For this act
of desperate courage the lives of the men, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>to the terrible right, or rather custom, of
war, were forfeited; and a party of soldiers
stormed the house, to put them all to the sword.
Already was the door forced, when the officer
of the attacking party hurried to the portal to
prevent a useless loss of life. His own soldiers
presented their bayonets to his breast, and threatened
to destroy him, but he persisted in his heroic
intention until all his men but two were
prevailed upon to show mercy. These two persevered:
they were Basque volunteers, of the
<i>Chapels Gory</i>, who never gave nor received quarter,
and they demanded to be permitted to kill
two of the men at least. More savage than
savages, they persisted in their demand, invoking
the sacred name of their Creator in aid
of the human sacrifice they were about to offer
up! Still undaunted, the resolute and humane officer
resisted their cruel intentions. Courage overcame
ferocity: the Carlist soldiers, and the old
men, women, and children in the house, were
saved. For this act of true heroism and philanthropy
the officer was immediately made a
lieutenant-colonel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was capital! He deserved to be promoted,
that he did. It was a noble action!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In a letter, written to him by the general
under whom he served, are these words:—‘It
is not out of mere form that I mention you, but
because I was witness, with extreme pleasure, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>your courageous and generous conduct. An entire
family and several Carlist soldiers owe their
lives to the resolute protection you afforded them
at the imminent peril of your own.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That action ought never to be forgotten. He
was in as much danger of his life as when fighting
with the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such a man as Lieutenant-colonel M——y is
not likely to forsake his colours. Soldiers and
sailors attach much importance to their colours.
A red-coat will die before he will lose his standard,
and you would almost as easily persuade a
blue-jacket to run his head into a cannon’s mouth
as to haul down his colours in the presence of an
enemy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean by colours? Are they
flags?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are: sailors hoist them on the masts of
their ships, and soldiers carry them at the head of
their different regiments. Red-coats will not lose
their colours without a struggle; and, as I hinted
before, Jack-tars are <i>forward</i> enough in <i>hoisting
them up</i>, but very <i>backward</i> in <i>hauling them down</i>.
When Admiral Duncan fought the Dutch, a seaman
in the midst of the battle nailed the colours
to the mast; and at the battle of Waterloo a
standard-bearer clasped the colours so fast in death
that a sergeant, trying to no purpose to wrench
them from him, on the near approach of an enemy,
made a violent effort, and, throwing the dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>corpse, colours and all over his shoulders, carried
them off together. The French seeing this, were
charmed with the heroism of the action, and hailed
it with shouts of applause.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a sight, to see him carrying off the
dead soldier with the colours in his hands!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Flags in the British navy are hoisted at the
heads of the main, fore, and mizen-masts; they are
red, white, or blue. When on the main-mast, they
are the mark of an admiral; when on the fore-mast,
of a vice-admiral; and when on the mizen-mast,
of a rear-admiral. The first flag in Great Britain
is the Royal Standard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That must be a very grand flag indeed!”</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>crosses of St. George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick,
are blended. This flag is appropriated to the
admiral of the fleet, who is the next officer under
the lord-high-admiral.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After the Union Flag comes that of the White
Squadron, at the main-mast-head, and then the
Blue, at the same mast-head. This is the lowest
which characterizes an admiral. Among soldiers
the colours are very various; and they generally
bear some motto, or some allusion to the battles
in which the troops have distinguished themselves.
Some have a sphinx, to represent service in Egypt;
others, an elephant or a tiger, in allusion to service
in India. It is a fine sight to see a squadron of
ships with their flags flying!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be; but there is one thing we cannot
make out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is that, boys?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It puzzles us to make out how one ship can
act in agreement with another, when they are
blowing about, or a long way off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, they call out to one another; that is the
way they manage the affair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call out to one another?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! ships talk with each other as freely as
you do with your companions, though you cannot
always hear them speak.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, how can they talk with one another?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By signals; which are of three kinds: day-signals,
night-signals, and fog-signals. The day-signals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>are made by hoisting flags, jacks, and pendants,
and by firing guns. The night-signals are
made by firing guns and rockets, and by showing
lights and false fires; and fog-signals are made by
firing of guns, at quick or slow intervals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, this is very curious; but how can the
hoisting a flag give any particular information?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would take too long, boys, to explain to
you the system of signals, if I fully understood it
myself, which I do not; but I will try to make you
comprehend that it is very easy for one ship to
talk with another. Now, look at this print of different
flags, and substitutes for flags, taken from that
talented work, the ‘United Service Journal,’ and
suppose that they stand for the same numbers as
are placed under them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! now we shall know something about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Read also what is written under, about the
cypher-flag and the substitutes.”</p>

<p class='c022'>When the cypher-flag is put above another, it adds 10,000.</p>

<p class='c022'>When the 1st substitute is put under a flag, it stands for the same
number as that flag.</p>

<p class='c022'>When placed above the flag, it adds 11,000.</p>

<p class='c022'>When the 2nd substitute is used, it is the same number as the
second flag flying.</p>

<p class='c022'>When uppermost, it adds 12,000.</p>

<p class='c022'>When the 3rd substitute is used, it stands for the same as the uppermost

<p class='c011'>“We are not able to make out how the flags
are to be used. You must please to explain it
to us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suppose, then, that every ship in the navy had
a general signal-book, full of such orders and such
sentences as are most likely to be wanted, and
every one of them numbered. Do you not see
that when flag No. 7 is hoisted by one ship, other
ships have only to look at No. 7 in their signal-book,
to know what it means.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Yes, that is very clear. But can thirteen flags
say all that can be wanted to be said?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A system of signals of thirteen flags, which
I once saw, was able, by using only four flags at a
time, to form nearly fourteen thousand combinations.
I will show you how to form numbers with
the flags in the print.</p>

<p class='c022'>Hoist it with the 1st substitute under it, and the
two will stand for 77.</p>

<p class='c022'>Hoist these with the 2nd substitute under them,
and they will stand for 777.</p>

<p class='c022'>Hoist all these with the 3rd substitute under
them, and they will stand for 7777.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How very curious! We never saw
anything like this before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are methods also of changing
the signals, to prevent an enemy
from deriving any advantage if the general
signal-book should fall into his
hands. The rapidity with which signals
are given and repeated by different ships
is astonishing. Up goes a flag, hoisted
by the Admiral, rolled round like a ball;
when it has reached the mast-head it bursts out,
and in a twinkling at the mast-head of other vessels
you see the same signal floating in the breeze.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is it that they can manage this so
cleverly?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Practice and good telescopes will do wonders.
And then the signal-officers, from the state of things
around them, know beforehand the flags which
are most likely to be wanted. You may form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>some notion, now, of ships being able to talk one
with another, when you see that thirteen flags can
send near fourteen thousand messages. There are
several plans by which soldiers may talk one with
another with their muskets.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With their muskets?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, as easily as sailors with their flags.
Then there are modes, both in the army and
navy, of holding communication by the use of telegraphs
of different descriptions. I have not the
time to dwell on these now, but you shall see an
alphabet, which has been invented for field-signals:
vedettes, or signal-men, in different attitudes, stand
for the letters. By this mode of signalizing, troops
may communicate with each other across a river,
or on other positions, very easily. When once you
have an alphabet to work with, you may convey
what message you like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, can men put themselves into the form
of letters?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is not necessary; for if a certain attitude
is understood to stand for a certain letter, it
amounts to the same thing. Here, then, you have
the alphabet.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“When there is a dot at the end of the arm it
represents the cap of the signal-man. You see,
then, that a man on one side a river might, by
making one letter at a time, communicate what
word he pleased to a man on the other side of the
river, who might signalize it to another in the same
way, and so on to any distance required. There
might also be other signs, signifying words, or, indeed,
sentences, such as ‘infantry,’ ‘cavalry,’ ‘advance,’—‘retreat,’
‘enemy,’ ‘squadron,’ ‘battalion,’
‘regiment.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Famous! famous! With a little puzzling, we
shall make it all out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt you will; patience and perseverance
will work wonders. My conversations with you
about soldiers and sailors bring back old scenes
to my mind, that I had well nigh forgotten. If
I should tell you the same things two or three
times over, or not be quite correct in my narration,
you must forgive me. True it is, that I have
seen, heard, and read a great deal, but my memory
is not what it once was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! Why, you seem to remember things as
if they were but yesterday. Can you tell us something
rather droll about sailors, just to finish up
with?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a description, given by a well-known
author, of a sailor when on shore, that will amuse
you. It is drawn with much truth and ability.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us hear it, uncle; let us hear it!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“The moment a sailor lands,” he says, “he
goes to see the watchmaker, or the old boy at The
Ship. His first object is to spend his money; but
his first sensation is, the strange firmness of the
earth, which he goes treading in a sort of heavy-light
way, half waggoner and half dancing-master,
his shoulders rolling, and his feet touching and
going; the same way, in short, in which he keeps
himself prepared for all the rolling chances of the
vessel, when on deck. There is always, to us,
this appearance of lightness of foot, and heavy
strength of upper works, in a sailor. And he feels
it himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is exactly to the life! It would be impossible
to describe a sailor’s walk better!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He lets his jacket fly open, and his shoulders
slouch, and his hair grow long, to be gathered into
a heavy pig-tail; but when full dressed, he prides
himself on a certain gentility of toe, on a white
stocking, and a natty shoe, issuing lightly out of
the flowing blue trowsers. His arms are neutral,
hanging and swinging in a curve aloof; his hands,
half open, look as if they had just been handling
ropes, and had no object in life but to handle them
again. He is proud of appearing in a new hat
and slops, with a belcher handkerchief flowing
loosely round his neck, and the corner of another
out of his pocket. Thus equipped, with pinchbeck
buckles in his shoes, which he bought for gold, he
puts some tobacco in his mouth, not as if he were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>going to use it directly, but as if he stuffed it in
a pouch on one side, as a pelican does fish, to
employ it hereafter; and so, with Bet Monson at
his side, and perhaps a cane or whanghee twisted
under his other arm, sallies forth to take possession
of all Lubberland.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! ha! ha! That is capital! He was
prettily taken in with his pinchbeck buckles;
but it would not matter, for they would pass
with him for gold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He buys everything that he comes athwart,
nuts, gingerbread, apples, shoe-strings, beer, brandy,
gin, buckles, knives, a watch,—two, if he has
money enough,—gowns, and handkerchiefs for Bet,
and his mother, and sisters; dozens of superfine
best men’s cotton stockings; dozens of superfine
best women’s cotton ditto; best good check, for
shirts, though he has too much already; infinite
needles and thread, to sew his trowsers with some
day; a footman’s laced hat; bear’s-grease to make
his hair grow, by way of joke; several sticks; all
sorts of Jews’ articles; a flute, which he can’t play,
and never intends; a leg of mutton, which he carries
somewhere to roast, and for a piece of which
the landlord of The Ship makes him pay twice
what he gave for the whole;—in short, all that
money can be spent upon, which is everything
but medicine gratis; and this he would insist on
paying for.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“Poor Jack! he is never to be trusted on shore
with money in his pocket.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He would buy all the painted parrots on an
Italian’s head, on purpose to break them, rather
than not spend his money. He has fiddles, and a
dance, at The Ship, with oceans of flip and grog;
and gives the blind fiddler tobacco for sweetmeats,
and half-a-crown for treading on his toe.
He asks the landlady, with a sigh, after her
daughter Nance, and finding that she is married
and in trouble, leaves five crowns for her; which
the old lady appropriates as part payment for a
shilling in advance. He goes to the Port playhouse
with Bet Monson, and a great red handkerchief
full of apples, gingerbread nuts, and fresh
beef; calls out for the fiddlers and ‘Rule Britannia;’
pelts Tom Sikes in the pit, and compares
Othello to the black ship’s cook, in his white
nightcap. When he comes to London, he and
some messmates take a hackney-coach full of Bet
Monsons and tobacco-pipes, and go through the
streets, smoking and lolling out of window. He
has ever been cautious of venturing on horseback;
and among his other sights in foreign parts, relates,
with unfeigned astonishment, how he has
seen the Turks ride;—‘Only,’ says he, guarding
against the hearer’s incredulity, ‘they have
saddle-boxes to hold ’em in, fore and aft; and
shovels like for stirrups.’ He will tell you how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the Chinese drink, and the Negurs dance, and
the monkeys pelt you with cocoa-nuts; and how
King Domy would have built him a mud hut,
and made him peer of the realm, if he would
have stopped with him, and taught him to make
trowsers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never was a better account of a sailor than
this. Everything about him seems to be thought
of.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has a sister at a ‘school for young ladies,’
who blushes with a mixture of pleasure and shame
at his appearance; and whose confusion he completes
by slipping four-pence into her hand, and
saying out loud, that he has ‘no more copper’
about him. His mother and elder sisters, at
home, doat on all he says and does, telling him,
however, that he is a great sea-fellow, and was
always wild ever since he was a hop-o’-my-thumb
no higher than the window-locker. He tells his
mother, she would be a duchess in Paranaboo;
at which the good old portly lady laughs and
looks proud. He frightens his sisters with
a mask, made after the New Zealand fashion,
and is forgiven for his learning. Their mantle-piece
is filled by him with shells and sharks’
teeth; and when he goes to sea again, there is
no end of tears, and ‘God bless you!’ and homemade
gingerbread.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have been told, boys, of a blockade, a
bombardment, and a siege, and now you shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>have a storming party, which is one of the most
desperate of military undertakings. Pity it is
that there should ever be occasion to resort to
it, for pillage and plunder never yet made a good
soldier, though they are thought of more than
they ought to be. A soldier should never <i>step
out</i> in disgrace, nor <i>halt</i> in the march of duty.
If there be one thing more than another that I
abhor, it is pillage and plunder.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do the soldiers when they storm a place plunder,
and do what they like?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It has been too common a thing in war, to
promise the soldiers a few days’ pillage before they
storm a place, to hearten them on; and they are
not backward to profit by the opportunity. Some
on these occasions act a brutal part; but there
are men in the army whose hearts are unhardened
by their profession, and whose generous
dispositions move them more to clemency than
cruelty. War has horrors enough, without adding
to its evils by selfish and reckless cruelty and
brutality. The soldier, whether he carries a musket,
or wears epaulettes on his shoulders, who, fired
with revenge and flushed with victory, stains his
blade with the blood of a vanquished enemy, or
ill-uses fear-struck and defenceless woman, is a
ruffian, and not worthy to be called a man. He
may think lightly of the curse of a dying husband
or brother; he may turn into mirth the
clasped hands and weeping eyes of injured innocence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>but the artillery of Heaven will roar in
his ears in an unlooked-for hour, and its thunders
will be directed against his heart;—but I
forget that you are waiting to hear of a storming
party. I have been present at some, and have
heard a description of many. I will tell you,
first, of the storming of Seringapatam in India,
in the year 1799, and then of the storming of
Ghuznee, in Persia, a year or two ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, then, for the storming of Seringapatam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should have mentioned to you, that one part
of the duty of a commander, especially when the
seat of war is but imperfectly known, is to take
care that military surveying is not neglected.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean by military surveying?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The art of military surveying, is to represent
on paper the features of a country, that the operations
of the service may be carried on with less
difficulty, and more effect. If the commander of
an army, or of a smaller force, is unacquainted
with the country or neighbourhood in which he is,
it will be necessary to reconnoitre it, for a knowledge
of hills, woods, rivers, and brooks, as well
as that of the force and position of the enemy.
Military surveying is much the same as reconnoitering,
only the latter is done rapidly with the
naked eye, the former with instruments, and with
greater care. But, I am forgetting the storming
of Seringapatam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are quite ready to hear all about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“In storming a place, in order to insure success,
it is necessary to act scrupulously according to orders
given; moving a minute before or after the
proper time may endanger the whole enterprise. I
will read you the Order under which the fifth regiment
acted on the night of the 19th of January
1812, in the great breach, by the third division,
at the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p class='c023'>“‘ORDER.</p>

<p class='c023'>“‘The fifth regiment will attack the entrance of
the ditch, at the junction of the counterscarpe with
the main wall of the place. Major Sturgeon will
show them the point of attack. They must issue
from the right of the convent of Santa Cruz. They
must have twelve axes, in order to cut down the
gate by which the ditch is entered at the junction
of the counterscarpe with the body of the place.
The fifth regiment is likewise to have twelve scaling
ladders, twenty-five feet long, and immediately
on entering the ditch are to scale the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fausse braye</span></i>,
in order to clear it of the enemy’s parties on their
left, towards the principal breach. It will throw
over any guns it may meet with, and will proceed
along the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fausse braye</span></i>, where it will wait until
Major-General Mackinnon’s column has passed on
to the main attack, when it will follow in its rear.
This regiment will make its attack at ten minutes
before eleven o’clock. The seventy-seventh regiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>will be in reserve on the right of the convent
of Santa Cruz.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see by this Order how necessary it is to be
scrupulously exact in a storm. The capture of Seringapatam,
the capital of the Mysore country, was,
to the East India Company, an object of great importance,
and the storming of the place was executed
with great boldness. That Tippoo Saib was
a treacherous and cruel tyrant there can be little
doubt; and, if you have ever visited the museum
of the East India House, you have seen a proof
of his ferocity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have never been there. What is it that
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is in the museum a musical instrument
that was made for Tippoo Saib. It is a kind of
organ, and when the handle of it is turned round
a tiger leaps on a prostrate British soldier, to tear
him to pieces. The piteous cries of the soldier, and
the savage yell of the tiger, afforded the tyrant
much amusement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then he must have been a cruel savage, sure
enough. We should like to see the museum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are many things in it which were taken
from Tippoo, and among them his silken banners,
decorated with the blazing sun, rent and torn by
the storm of battle; his helm, his armour, and
his mantle. His helmet is made of brass, with a
silk covering, and his mantle has on it an inscription,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>written in Persian, which says that it had
been dipped in the holy well at Mecca, and rendered
invulnerable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall, perhaps, see the India House Museum
some day, and we shall be sure to look for
the tiger and the soldier.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tippoo Saib was the son of Hyder Ally; but
he was much bolder and much more cunning and
ferocious than his father. Soon after he ascended
the throne, he attacked General Matthews, who
had penetrated to Bednore, the capital of Cadnore.
With his cavalry, and a few French troops, he
made a desperate attack on the general, who, with
the loss of five hundred Englishmen, took refuge in
Bednore, where he soon surrendered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tippoo knew how to fight, it seems.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did; but in battles, whether on sea or land,
he who is a conqueror to-day may be a captive
to-morrow. Tippoo found this to his cost. Detected
in corresponding with the French, and
plotting against the English, for their expulsion
from India, it was determined to attack him in
his capital. Desperate was the attack of the British
and native troops, and desperate the defence
of Tippoo, with his guards and his tiger grenadiers.
General Harris was the British commander; but
the attack on Seringapatam was entrusted to
Major-General Baird, who had once been taken
prisoner by Tippoo, and kept in irons for near
four years.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“He would be sure to do his best, then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt he did. For some days the walls
of Seringapatam were battered. At last a practicable
breach was made, and then the place was
stormed. Ten flank companies, supported by the
12th, 33rd, 73rd, and 74th regiments, with three
corps of grenadier sepoys, and two hundred men
from the troops of his highness the Nizam, formed
the assaulting party, assisted by artillery-men
and pioneers, while the battalions of Madras sepoys
supported them in the trenches. Major-General
Baird divided his forces, that he might the
more easily clear the ramparts right and left.
Colonel Sherbrooke led one party, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Dunlop the other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tippoo would not be conquered very easily;
he would never surrender.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A singular circumstance took place during the
attack, that much favoured the British troops. A
shot struck the chain that supported the draw-bridge,
and divided it. Down fell the bridge, and
thus enabled the besiegers to cross the moat.
There was a rush to defend the bridge, and terrible
was the carnage upon it; but British troops are
not easily driven back, and they won their way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How glad the British would be to see the
draw-bridge fall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Glad enough! Colonel Sherbrooke and Colonel
Dunlop were both successful in their attacks. The
tiger grenadiers made a desperate sortie from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>sally-port, but they were met by some brave Highlanders
and others, and, in spite of all resistance,
the place was taken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What became of Tippoo? was he taken prisoner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not alive. He was pressing on to encourage
his troops, when he received a musket-ball in his
right side; and soon after another. His horse
fell, being wounded, and then Tippoo’s turban fell
from his head.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Tippoo! Then it was all over with
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was placed, wounded as he was, on his
palanquin near the gate under the archway, and
one of his domestics who survived, said, that a
soldier who came up, snatched at his rich sword-belt,
but Tippoo made a cut at him with his sword and
wounded him. This enraged the soldier, who, raising
his musket, shot him through the temples,
when he instantly fell and expired.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can’t help being sorry for him, cruel as he
was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When his body was found it was under a
heap of slain, and despoiled of sword, jacket and
turban. On his right arm was fastened an amulet
of metal, like silver, sewed up in fine flowered silk.
This was a talisman, for, besides the metal, it contained
some small manuscripts, in magic Arabic
and Persian characters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The talisman did not save him from being
killed.”</p>

<p>TIPPOO SAIB.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“It did not: his time was come. And it shows
us the uncertainty of the life of a king as well as
that of a common soldier. What was Tippoo in
the morning when he quitted his palace? why, a
king! a Sultan as proud as wealth and power
could make him. What was he before set of sun?
A disfigured lump of breathless clay! deprived not
only of his capital and his kingdom, but also of
his life. His proud palace, too, was occupied by
General Baird; he whom Tippoo had before kept
in cruel bondage for so long a period, at a short
distance only from that gateway under which the
tyrant fell!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There were a great number killed on both sides,
no doubt?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot tell the loss on the part of Tippoo,
but on the English side there were between five
and six hundred, reckoning killed, wounded and
missing, altogether.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We should think it a terrible thing to see
one man killed, but five or six hundred! that is
dreadful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if I now tell you of the storming of
Ghuznee, you will have had enough of fighting for
one while. The storming of Ghuznee, in Affghanistan
in Eastern Persia, a year or two ago,
produced a strong sensation, both on account of
the desperate resistance of the garrison and the
courage and complete success of the besiegers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please to give us the account, and we will not
interrupt you with a single word.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“I should have told you, that in storming a
place it is customary for a small party to go first.
This party is composed of soldiers who freely
volunteer their services; it is called the ‘forlorn
hope,’ on account of the extreme peril hazarded
by the party. In this instance the party was a
strong one. When a soldier goes on a forlorn
hope he often does two things at once—he wins a
reputation for bravery and loses his name from the
muster-roll. The gate of the fortress was blown
in with gunpowder, and when the single bugle
sounded, the stormers, headed by Colonel Dennie,
rushed into the dark and smoking entrance, where
they came at once into deadly conflict with the
Affghans of the garrison. It was night, and
nothing could be distinctly seen in the gateway;
but the clash and clang of contending swords and
bayonets were fearful. Hand to hand some fought
their way, others poured in, as opportunity occurred,
at pistol-shot, a destructive fire of musketry.
At last they could see, as they penetrated further,
a little of the blue sky, and, here and there, a twinkling
star, over the heads of their enemies; but they
had no time for star-gazing. On they went, till
a force of four companies had, in some sort, established
themselves in the fortress! A loud cheer was
then raised to announce their success to their
companions outside the place. Brigadier Sale was
bringing up his men to support the forlorn hope,
when he met an engineer officer who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>injured by the explosion at the gate. This officer
told him the forlorn hope could not force its way,
the passage was so choked up with rubbish. Brigadier
Sale, knowing that under such circumstances
it would be sacrificing his party to proceed, sounded
a retreat, and thereby put the victorious forlorn
hope in extreme danger from the want of support.
This was, however, but for a short time, for, soon
after, the success of the stormers was made known
to him. The Brigadier then advanced with his
men, but was met by a large body of Affghans,
rushing headlong from the ramparts to the opening
to make their escape. The encounter was
desperate; and one of the Affghans, leaping over
the fallen timber, brought down the brigadier with
a cut in the face with his sharp shumsheer, striking
him also, as he fell, another stunning blow.
The Affghan lost his footing, and grappling his
enemy, rolled with him on the ground. This was
a critical moment: the brigadier contrived to grasp
the Affghan’s hand, so as to keep fast the hilt of
his shumsheer till Captain Kershaw came up and
passed his sabre through his body. Still the desperate
struggle continued, for the infuriated Affghan
was not subdued till the brigadier got his
right hand sufficiently at liberty to cleave the head
of his opponent with his sword, when the latter
shouted out ‘Ue Allah!’ and breathed his last.
Allah, or Ullah, is the name the Mahomedans give
to God.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“Though Brigadier Sale was unable at the
moment to enter on active service, he yet calmly
directed the movements of his men. There was desperate
fighting; but British muskets and British
bayonets won their way, and repeated shouts from
the area of the fortress told the commander-in-chief,
posted on the heights, that the walls were
in possession of his troops. An order was now
given to turn every gun on the heights towards
the citadel. Colonel Croker with his troops entered
the gates, winding his way upwards, as well
as the ruins of the place would allow, towards the
citadel, while the reserve troops, which had closed
up close to the walls, had to endure the fire of
hidden enemies from the ramparts. At last the
reserve troops also entered the gates. It was
thought the most desperate resistance would take
place in the citadel, but it was not so, for Mohammed
Hyder, in consternation at the boldness of the
stormers, abandoned the mound. The gates of
the citadel were burst open, and the colours of
the 13th light infantry, and of the 17th regiment,
were soon seen waving on the stronghold of Ghuznee.
All was confusion; the rattle of muskets, the
clashing of bayonets and swords, and the shrieks of
the women of the harem were mingled, while the
cries and groans of the wounded, and the flight of
the fugitives increased the general consternation
of the garrison. The reserve troops pressed on
to the eastern rampart, when a body of concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Affghans madly rushed forth, sword in hand, to cut
a passage to the gateway. Just then a group of
wearied soldiers were resting on the low ground
below the citadel, where many of the wounded
men lay, and where hundreds of Affghan horses
were wildly galloping to and fro. On this group
the furious Affghans rushed. The soldiers sprang
to their feet, and a dreadful carnage ensued. A
wild fusillade was directed against the Affghans,
who fell, grinding their teeth with rage, crying,
‘Ue Allah!’ or giving vent to curses. Courage,
calmness, rage, suffering, supplication, and despair,
were all visible. The dying were mingled with
the dead. The narrow streets of the town were
scoured by the besiegers, the detached tower was
carried by the gorge, and the garrison completely
subdued. In little better than two hours after the
attack commenced, Ghuznee, with its garrison of
three thousand five hundred men, was taken, without
a single ladder being raised in escalade—thus
showing the wondrous superiority of British valour
and British tactics.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! that was a very desperate affair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was; but war is a desperate game; it is
often so to the winner, and always to the loser.
There has been sad news lately from India. The
Affghans have been victorious, some thousands of
our troops have fallen, and the wives of several
British officers are in the hands of the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will now, boys, enter a little into the
tactics and stratagems of war. Nothing like being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>fair and above-board in the common transactions
of life; but in war, he who can take a prisoner
instead of taking his life does a good thing; and
he who by tactics or stratagems can compel an
army to lay down their arms, instead of covering
the ground with slain, does better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! you must please to make everything as
plain to us as you can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will! I will! As no nation is justified in
going to war when peaceable means can be resorted
to with success, so no general ought to
destroy human life while he can accomplish his
ends by stratagem. The difference between the
tactics of war and the stratagems of war is this.
Tactics are superior arrangements made by knowledge
and genius to overcome an enemy, while
stratagems are feints, made to deceive him. Tactics
are, therefore, of the most importance, for they will
always be called into play, while stratagems can
only be occasionally resorted to. A good player
at chess, or draughts, will beat an opponent by his
superior skill or tactics, without once resorting to
a stratagem, while an indifferent player will
sometimes win a game by resorting to the stratagem
of giving his adversary one piece, and capturing
two in return.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O yes! It is very plain that there is a great
difference between stratagems and tactics.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I was a schoolboy, the whole school, in
play-hours, was divided into two parties, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>captain at the head of each, and many a brave
encounter took place in our mimic battles. One
of our captains, named Baines, was famous for stratagems,
and by the aid of these he was frequently
successful, though his opponent, Captain Bentley,
was greatly his superior in strength and activity.
On one occasion, Baines separated himself from his
party, withdrawing himself on the left flank, crying
out, ‘O that I had an enemy that dared to
meet me hand to hand!’ Bentley, knowing himself
to be more than a match for his opponent, instantly
followed him, when, on a signal given by
Baines, two of his strongest soldiers ran to support
him, while the rest flung themselves between Bentley’s
troops and their commander, to prevent any
assistance being given. The consequence followed,
that Bentley was soon a prisoner, with his hands
tied behind his back, and Baines, with little exertion,
obtained a complete victory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was a famous stratagem! How could
Bentley be so foolish as to follow him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On another occasion, Baines took possession
alone of a rock, so steep on all sides that it
could only be scaled by the aid of a ladder;
from the top of this rock he pelted his opponents;
when Bentley, too proud, to be driven away by
Baines alone, mounted the ladder to dislodge
him. No sooner, however, had he gained the
summit of the rock than Baines, who had let
himself down on the opposite side with a rope,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>appeared at the bottom, and threw down the
ladder, so that Captain Bentley, from the top
of the rock which he had no means of descending,
had the mortification to see his little army
discomfited for the want of a commander.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Capital! capital! Baines was too much for
Bentley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was after these stratagems that he practised
a third. Bentley was very fond of addressing
his party from a little boat that was moored
by the side of the broad brook. One day, as he
was standing in the boat addressing his troops,
and telling them that <i>in the hour of danger he
would always be found at their head</i>, the boat imperceptibly
glided from the bank towards the middle
of the stream. Bentley perceiving the boat
to be unmoored, turned round, when he saw the
weakest of Baines’s soldiers, half hid among the
opposite bushes, pulling at a rope, which had been
fastened beforehand to the boat. By this stratagem
Bentley was kept in the middle of his brook
till the whole of his army was discomfited, Baines
repeatedly crying out, ‘<i>In the hour of danger you
will find me at your head!</i>’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Famous! famous! That Baines would have
made a good general!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A knowledge of tactics is indispensable to a
general and to an admiral; remembrance too, of
the common details and evolutions should be kept
up, otherwise officers, though their tactics may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>good, may make arrangements and give orders,
difficult to be executed. The Prussian tactics
were, to concentrate power and to attack the chief
points of an enemy in succession, whereas French
tactics attack all points, with divided forces, at
one and the same time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, the one is just the contrary to the
other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To go back to the days of Rome. At the
battle of Actium, Augustus, finding himself inferior
to Mark Anthony in the number of his
ships, had the sagacity to draw up his line of
battle along the entrance of the Gulph of Ambracia,
and thereby to make up for his deficiency.
This naval manœuvre, as well as that of getting
to windward of the enemy, in order to bear down
upon him with more certainty and effect, exists
to the present day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Augustus acted wisely, for many of Mark Anthony’s
ships had not room to fight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In ancient times ships had sharp prows, with
which they ran one against another. The battle
was then carried on by boarding, but now cannon-shot
decides almost every action. Ships now fight
broadside to broadside; and whenever a vessel can
take another at such a disadvantage as to sweep her
decks from stem to stern, this is called ‘raking her
fore and aft.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! gunpowder has made a great difference
in that respect.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“The Duke of Saxe Weimar, at the siege of
Brissack, practised a stratagem with success. The
Imperialists had a strong post on a hill. The
duke ordered the drums and trumpets of the different
corps to be stationed in a neighbouring
wood. When these began to play, the Imperialists,
thinking they were about to be attacked
in that quarter, left the strong position they
occupied on the hill, which was instantly taken
possession of by the duke.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The duke was too cunning for them a great
deal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Dutch, the Spanish, and the French,
have all had their day on the ocean; but they are
not likely to have it again at present.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“John Clark, Esq. a Fellow of the Society of
Scottish Antiquaries, introduced a new kind of
naval tactics, since proved to be eminently successful.
Before his tactics were introduced British
ships were almost always victorious in battles
between single ships, while in conflicts of
whole fleets they seldom obtained an advantage.
Their intrepidity and desire to engage, led them
to attack from windward, which enabled their
enemies, formed ready for them to leeward, to
disable them, as they came into action, by injuring
their masts and rigging, from following
them when they chose to retire. Thus, fleet
after fleet escaped, because British tars could not
come into close action. Mr. Clark’s system found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>a remedy for this evil—by breaking the line. His
principle is, to exert the chief force against the
weakest or most vulnerable part of the enemy’s line.
Admiral Rodney first broke through the French
fleet on this principle, when its rear was driven
to leeward in confusion and torn to pieces by
a raking fire. Do you not understand, boys, that
if an admiral, by cutting off one half of an enemy’s
fleet, can bring the whole of his ships to
bear on that part, he may, perhaps, obtain a victory
before the other half of the enemy’s fleet
can join the battle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O yes, that is very clear. No wonder that admirals
should wish to break the enemy’s line.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lords Howe and Vincent, Duncan, and Nelson,
have all followed out this principle with great success.
Tactics are quite as necessary in the army
as in the navy. Frederick the Great once gave
much encouragement to a stranger who undertook
to introduce some new and important tactics
into his army. But General De Zeithen,
seeing through the hollowness of the stranger’s
pretensions, laid an ambuscade for him in a
sham fight, took him prisoner, and brought him
in bound, on horseback; which circumstance opened
the eyes of Frederick to the empty pretensions
of his new favourite.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well done, General De Zeithen! His tactics
were better than those of the would-be general.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“When Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Mehemet
Ali, was at Damascus, in Syria, with an army
of forty thousand men, an old dervise arrived
there, and hastened to give his staff to Ibrahim.
In this staff the old dervise had safely carried a
scrap of paper from Mehemet Ali, containing these
words—‘Acre has been taken—return to Egypt.’
A council was called, and the European advisers
of Ibrahim strongly urged him to retire, in one
body, by the shortest road coastward, with baggage
and provisions, as he would then be able
to set every attack at defiance. Ibrahim unaccountably
neglected this proposal, and following
out his own mistaken plan, broke up his army
into six divisions, giving fourteen days’ provisions
to each, and sent them on to be harassed and
distressed by the Turks and mountaineers, who
hung upon them during the whole of their
march. Ibrahim paid dear for his error in dividing
his troops. It took him thirty-nine days
to reach Gaza, during which time he twice
marched round the Dead Sea, having mistaken
his road, pursued by his enemies, who allowed
him no respite, and compelled his troops to prolong
their existence by eating herbs. It is said,
that even in the retreat of Buonaparte from
Moscow greater hardships were not endured than
in that of Ibrahim Pasha from Syria.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How foolish, to divide his army.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“It was foolish, and no doubt he thought so,
long before he arrived at Gaza. The more you
hear or read of tactics, the clearer you will see
that the better they are understood the more
likely is an army to be successful. It is generally
agreed that there are some principles which
should always be strictly attended to in the
formation of all military bodies.</p>

<p class='c011'>“First, Each regiment, or integral part of an
army, must be under the uniform command of
one man, interested in its good appearance, efficiency,
and success, who must be responsible for
his charge, and removeable when not found equal
to his duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Secondly, Its size should not be too great to
admit of his personal inspection and superintendence,
under all the circumstances of its ordinary
situation, so that he may be thoroughly acquainted
with every officer, and, generally, with
the men.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thirdly, Promotion should be confined, as much
as the interests of the service will permit, within
each regiment, so that those who share equally
in the perils of any duty should also share equally
in the advantages resulting therefrom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fourthly, This promotion should be at such
a rate as to prevent men arriving at commands
requiring much energy and exertion, when they
are in mind and body too much debilitated for
either.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“Those appear to be very excellent regulations.
Do soldiers like best to go abroad or to remain
at home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are, no doubt, those who prefer to rest
in old England, but many officers feel most <i>at home</i>
when <i>abroad</i>, well knowing that the <i>field</i> is the
<i>high road</i> to promotion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very likely, uncle! very likely!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are many war terms, the precise meaning
of which can hardly be given—having different
significations attached to them. Thus, an <i>action</i> may
be considered to be a battle between the smaller
bodies of troops. The attempt of the French to
take Hougomont, at the battle of Waterloo, was
an <i>attack</i>; it was an assault to gain a post. The
expedition of the Spanish Armada was an <i>attempt</i>;
but, on account of the valour of British seamen, it
did not succeed. The fight on the fields of Waterloo
was a <i>battle</i>; the forces of two armies were
engaged. The investment of Pampluna by the
Duke of Wellington was a <i>blockade</i>, for the surrounding
troops shut up all the avenues to the
place, and prevented anything from going in or
out. The taking of Flushing, in the Isle of Walcheren,
was a <i>bombardment</i>, for the place was subdued
by throwing shells into it, and battering it
with cannon. Buonaparte’s expedition to Egypt
was a <i>descent</i>; it was a sudden, hostile entrance
into a country. The loss sustained by Mourad-Bey
at the battle of the Pyramids, was a <i>defeat</i>; it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the overthrow of an army. The battle of the Nile
was an <i>engagement</i>; it was a fight between two
fleets. The British troops, sent out to Egypt under
Abercrombie, was an <i>expedition</i>; it was a force
sent out on a military enterprise. The taking
possession of Algiers by the French was an <i>invasion</i>;
it was the hostile occupation of a country,
with intent to retain it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The engagement between the Shannon and the
Chesapeake was a <i>sea-fight</i>; it was a battle between
two ships. The taking of Seringapatam was a
<i>storm</i>; it was accomplished by a sudden and violent
assault. The reduction of Antwerp was a
<i>siege</i>; the place was invested by an army, and
approached by covert ways. A <i>surprise</i> is an unexpected
assault and capture. A <i>skirmish</i> is an
encounter between two smaller bodies of troops in
the neighbourhood of their respective armies. A
<i>repulse</i>, is the disaster of being beaten back by an
enemy. The destruction of the powder-magazine
at Jean D’Acre was an <i>explosion</i>; it was the
blowing up of the magazine, though accidentally
accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If we can remember one half you have told
us, we shall be able to talk like old soldiers.
You have been a great deal abroad, uncle, in your
time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and among other places, I have served in
Jamaica, and been in the cave of the famous Obi
Man, called Three-fingered Jack.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Who was Three-fingered Jack? Oh! do tell
us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Three-fingered Jack was a desperate fellow, that
lived a lawless life in the woods. He was said to
be as strong as three men; his speed was like that
of the greyhound, and his courage equal to the
most daring adventurer. He pretended to practise
Obi, or African necromancy; and the simple negroes
believed him capable of doing dreadful things.
His deeds were so desperate that his name struck
terror into the surrounding neighbourhood, and
large rewards were offered for his apprehension, in
vain. Both the civil and military authorities he
set at nought, and in spite of them both, continued
his depredations.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a terrible fellow! And did they take
him at last?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You shall hear. Sometimes Jack suddenly
appeared among the negroes when they were assembled
before the plantation house, two or three
hundred of them together, just as if he had sprung
up from the ground, and when he held up his
three-fingered hand they would fall prostrate before
him. Unawed by the overseer or proprietor, he
levied his contributions, demanding and receiving
what he wanted. At last Quashi, a Maroon negro,
one of the race of coloured men, who for a long
time dwelt in the strongholds of the Blue Mountains,
undertook to destroy him.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“And did he? It was no easy matter to kill
Three-fingered Jack. Did he really kill him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did; for, taking a nephew to assist him, he
hunted him from cover to cover, until, after two
or three times grappling with him, he shot Jack as
he was climbing a hill; severed his head from his
body, and obtained a large reward.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Motto for a soldier.—Glory.—Reply to a challenge.—The caricature.—Discharges.—A
picquet, sentinel, vedette, advanced guard, and
flag of truce.—Crossing rivers.—Presentations.—Camps of instruction.—Comfort
of a cigar.—Tribute to the brave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The love of country is creditable to every
heart; and I would have you, boys, cherish it in
yours. I would, if I could, have every soldier,
and indeed every Englishman, take for his motto,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Old England for ever!</div>
      <div class='line'>The land, boys, we live in!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and make up his mind that it is his bounden
duty to do all he can for the country that gave
him birth. Most of the old boys at Greenwich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Hospital, and Chelsea College, who have lost an
arm or a leg, or are otherwise injured, would
heartily join in this sentiment, though they somehow
seem to think fighting, and their country’s
good, the same thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When a soldier is wounded, no doubt he tries
to comfort himself with the honour he has got in
the battle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O boys! boys! ‘Will honour take away the
grief of a wound?’ A soldier had need have something
better to support him than the mere love of
glory: he ought to have the consolation of knowing
that he has fought in a just cause, and that it
is his country’s good, and not his own that he aims
at. In my time, perhaps, I have run after the
bubble glory as ardently as the boy pursues his
butterfly; but there are seasons—I speak from experience—when
the heart of a soldier is sick of war;
and then he muses and moralizes like other men.
When, harassed, day after day, and night after
night, when, bivouacing on the cold ground, or
watching by the dying embers of the camp-fire,
and, especially, when lying among the wounded on
the battle-field, he sees friends and foes around
him who have been swept down by the sharp
scythe of war, he yearns for the calm quiet, the
soothing peacefulness of a happy home, where the
wasting sword of battle is unknown; and then, like
others, he can break out in ardent exclamations
against mad ambition, questioning the value of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>mere glory, and even doubting the lawfulness of
making earthly honours an object of his desires.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>‘O glory! glory! Mighty one on earth!</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“You see, that though I am an old soldier, I
have no notion of men fighting for mere glory.
The good of their country and the real welfare of
those around them is a better motive to move a
soldier’s or a sailor’s heart than all the glory that
can be acquired.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Officers sometimes fight duels, uncle, that cannot
be for the good of their country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very true. He who kills another in a duel
lays up for himself a bed of briers and a pillow of
thorns. There are restless nights and ugly dreams
in store for him. Perhaps you may have heard of
the reply that was once given to a challenge. As,
however, it is short, I will repeat it to you. It
ran pretty much in this manner: ‘I have two
objections to this duel affair; the one is, lest I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>should hurt you, and the other is, lest you should
hurt me. I do not see any good that it would do
me to put a bullet through any part, though even
the least dangerous part of your body. As to myself,
I think it more sensible to avoid than to place
myself in the way of anything harmful. I am
under great apprehension you might hit me: that
being the case, I think it more advisable to stay at
a distance. If you want to try your pistols, take
some object—a tree, or anything else about my
dimensions; if you hit that, send me word, and
I shall acknowledge that if I had been in the same
place you might have hit me.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was a famous answer, however.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I once saw a caricature of two sailors fighting
a duel in a saw-pit with blunderbusses. If this
method should ever become popular, the number
of duels will not be very great. ‘Do you know
the use of the sword?’ was once tauntingly asked
of a brave officer by a mad-headed young ensign,
who wished to provoke him to a duel. ‘Better
than you do, young man,’ was the noble reply:
‘A soldier’s sword should defend his country from
her foes, and not be plunged into the hearts of her
friends.’ I knew a private soldier in the dragoons,
well educated, but of a proud and violent temper,
who quarrelled with his captain, and sent him a
challenge. The captain refused to fight with a
private; and this so wounded the pride of the dragoon
that he destroyed himself with one of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>own pistole. I would have all such untractable,
reckless spirits discharged from the army.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When are soldiers discharged?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Under different circumstances. We will not
here allude to desertion, for then, men and muskets
too sometimes <i>go off</i> without being <i>discharged</i>. At
times soldiers are found unfit for service; they
have purchased their liberty; the army has been
reduced; their period of service has been completed;
or some crime has been committed by them,
on account of which they are dismissed with disgrace.
It often happens, however, that a soldier,
unfit for one duty, is very capable of performing
another, and thus many are invalided; they are put
on garrison duty, though unfit for general service.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! that seems a very good plan. Garrison-duty,
then, is not so hard as other service?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not. Sometimes, when soldiers are discharged,
they have pensions, and sometimes they
have not. Many a man, who is not active enough
for a picquet in the field, makes a good sentinel in
garrison.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is a picquet?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A picquet is an out-guard, posted before an
army, to reconnoitre and give notice of the approach
of an enemy. Picquets have been called the watchdogs
of an army.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is a picquet and a sentinel the same?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; for a sentinel is one man, whereas picquets
are often strong bodies of horse and foot. Sentinels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>in the night should be careful not to give false
alarms. I knew of one case, wherein a camp was
put in confusion by a sentinel firing his piece at
a horse, which had strayed; the sentinel mistook
the animal for an enemy—the alarm became general,
but at last the cause of it was discovered. In case
of a sudden surprise, the picquet guard make what
resistance they can, that the army may have time
to get ready. Picquets should be composed of
smart fellows, all alive and equal to their undertaking;
men who will behave kindly to the inhabitants
around them, and keep on good terms
with them. Telescopes and pocket-compasses are
very necessary to picquets. At night, sounds may
be heard at a great distance, and the vedettes
posted by the picquet, should be very silent to
catch a distant sound. At night, too, a person
can see better, looking up hill than looking down.
These, and a hundred other things, should be well
known by picquets, to render them thoroughly
useful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You did not say what a vedette was?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A vedette is a sentinel on horseback. His
carbine should be advanced ready for use, and his
horse’s head turned in the direction of expected
danger. Once, when I was on a picquet in Spain,
near Corunna, a vedette gave the alarm, and a
body of horse burst upon us so suddenly that had
it not been for a couple of carts and some timber,
which we had but just dragged across the narrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>pass before us, every soldier must have been sacrificed.
These are moments that try men, and tell
us what they are. Advanced guards are parties
of horse or foot, and frequently of both the one
and the other, marching on before large forces, and
thus covering the front of a column.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do soldiers manage when a flag of
truce is sent?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you. A flag of truce is sent to
an enemy when a cessation of hostilities is required;
when time is wanted to bury the dead,
or when articles of peace are about to be drawn
up. It is the duty of an officer carrying a flag
of truce to make the best of his eyes, that he
may observe all he can of the strength and position
of the enemy. And when a flag of truce
arrives the receivers of it should blindfold the
messenger who bears it, if he goes to head-quarters.
The bearer of a flag of truce is generally
preceded by a trumpeter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do soldiers manage to get across
brooks, that are deep, and rivers? That must
be no easy matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The crossing of great rivers is one of the
most difficult of military operations, yet this is
frequently necessary to be done in the face of
an enemy. It is effected in different ways;
sometimes a river, which cannot be crossed in a
straight line, may be crossed in a slant one.
When not fordable at all, pontoons, and pontoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>bridges are resorted to. Pontoons are flat-bottomed
boats, made of wood, but lined with
tin or copper, as the case may be, a little better
than twenty feet long. Bridges of boats,
too, are used, as well as cables, stretched from
the bank by tackles and capstans, and resting
on the decks of vessels, moored at different
distances. Flying bridges are at times very serviceable.
They are formed by anchoring a floating
body in the water to receive the action of
the stream obliquely, by which a force is derived
from the current to move the vessel across
the river. Then, there are rafts of timber, casks,
air-tight cases, and inflated skins, resorted to, as
well as carriage-bridges, and suspension-bridges,
bridges on trestles, piles, truss-frames, and other
applications of carpentry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! tell us what an inspection is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Inspections, like many other duties, are only
useful when they are well and efficiently performed.
An inspecting general should have a
thorough knowledge of his profession, a quick
eye, a sound judgment, a love for the service, a
nice sense of honour, and an independent mind,
altogether inaccessible to flattery. In a word,
he should do what he undertakes to do; he
should patiently and narrowly examine the troops
under inspection, commending and encouraging
soldierlike conduct, and reproving and correcting
what is deserving of censure.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“No doubt, inspections must be very good
things!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will show you how an inspection may be
rendered useless. Fancy to yourselves, boys, a
general, setting off with his aid-de-camp in a
great bustle, and in high good humour, determined
to hurry through his duties. You may
be sure that the colonel and the adjutant of
the troops to be inspected will not be inattentive
to him; and if the colonel and adjutant are
forward, the paymaster, the quarter-master, and
the surgeon are not likely to be backward. How
can the kind-hearted general make himself disagreeable
to others by finding fault, when every
one is trying to be agreeable to him? The thing
is out of the question; and he looks with a favourable
eye on everything in the barracks, the
hospital, and the books. He is highly gratified
in finding such order and discipline, and praises
much, and censures very little. He must be very
different from the common character of men, if
a well-supplied mess, good wines, and complimentary
speeches, should sour his temper; so
that when the review, the grand field-day comes,
on the morrow, he must be a Turk if he does
not regard things with a kindly spirit. He is
struck with the admirable manner in which the
battalion is put through the manœuvres by the
senior major and captain; both manual and
platoon exercises are ably performed, and all goes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>off surprisingly. With a courteous and condescending
air, he approaches the colonel, in the fulness of
his heart, and thus addresses him:—‘Colonel, the
soldierlike bearing, and general appearance of the
men under your command, afford me much satisfaction.
They show what British soldiers, under
the command of British officers, can attain. Their
steadiness and promptitude under arms, and the
correctness and precision of their movements, are
highly creditable to you and to them. I trust that
a spirit of emulation will be kept up among the
troops, so that they will never decline from their
present high state of efficiency, nor forfeit the
good opinion they now deserve.’ Now, if all
this were to be huddled up in haste, instead of
occupying a reasonable time for its accomplishment,
and good humour and kindly feeling were
thus allowed to take the place of discipline and
duty, it is clear that very little advantage would
be obtained from the inspection. A sense of duty,
and a high and honourable bearing, should fill the
bosom of a soldier, whether he be a drill-sergeant
or a commanding-officer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A review must be a grand sight!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many of them are very much so. The review
which took place 7th July, 1824, before
the Duke of York, when the guards were present,
is thus described:—‘The whole of the movements
were executed with a degree of precision
which excited universal admiration, and received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>the unqualified approbation of the commander-in-chief.
It would be difficult to imagine anything,
except an actual field-of-battle, more terrific
than the view of the troops when performing
some of the attacks. One brigade charging
at full gallop, the other supporting them in
the rear; the roaring of the artillery in the flanks;
the irregular discharge of carbines by the pursuers;
the sounding of trumpets, and neighing of
steeds, all combined in forcing upon the mind
a powerful idea of a scene of real warfare.’ A
presentation is often an imposing spectacle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is a presentation?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Presentations are of different kinds. Sometimes
colours are presented, and sometimes other
things. In January 1831, King William was
pleased to declare himself colonel-in-chief of the
household brigade of cavalry, consisting of the
first and second regiments of life-guards and
the royal regiment of horse-guards. His Majesty
expressed his intention to present to each of the
two regiments of life-guards a pair of silver kettle
drums, constructed of fine silver, ornamented
with royal and regimental devices, of fretted
silver, in high relief, with the name of the sovereign,
the number and title of the regiment, and
the date of presentation, on each drum. The
second regiment received these May 6th, 1831.
When the ninetieth regiment of light-infantry
was presented with a new stand of colours, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the square of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham,
Lieutenant-General Sir Hussey Vivian concluded
his address to the troops in the following words:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before I conclude, I must impress upon
you, that at all times the watchword of a soldier
ought to be ‘Honour and fidelity.’ To attain
this, the governing principle of his conduct
must be, ‘obedience to the orders of his superiors.’
I will remind you of the last, that most
impressive order of that great naval commander,
who fell in the most glorious victory ever
gained by the navy of England, and who in
falling sealed the maritime ascendency of the
country, annihilating the fleets of France and
Spain,—I say, I must remind you of that last,
that most impressive order, which he issued to
those brave men under his command, calling
upon them to recollect that ‘England expects
every man to do his duty,’ an order so nobly
given, and so gloriously and triumphantly executed,
that the remembrance of it can never be
effaced from the annals of our country. And,
lastly, I must beg of you never to forget, when
marching against the enemy to victory and glory,
as I have no doubt you will do, should an
opportunity offer; I say, when marching against
the enemy under those colours which I now
place in your care, I call on you never to forget
that they are to be stained only with your blood;
to be surrendered only with your lives.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Sir Hussey Vivian knew how to animate
his men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many military men say, that camps of instruction
ought to be formed in England, that
soldiers may become more accustomed to the
usages of war, and made more perfect in their
duty. They have them in France, and other countries:
and one bad effect has certainly followed
the plan, it has made the people more fond
of fighting than they were before. You are no
smokers, boys, and therefore can hardly conceive
what a luxury a cigar is, under some circumstances.
You shall hear what a brother officer
says on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! let us know all about his cigar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Late on the eve of the memorable battle
of Waterloo,’ says one who was engaged in the
strife, ‘the regiment to which I belonged took
up its position on that hard-fought field, in front
of Hougomont, or, more properly speaking, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Château de Goumont</span>, a strong farm-house, and
the key-stone of the British line. The sun set
red, ominously foretelling stormy weather; and
about dark the rain descended in torrents. Our
situation, as may easily be conceived, was none
of the most enviable, being totally destitute of
tents or field <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</span></i>. We bivouacked in line;
and here and there might be seen, through the
murky gloom of night, men huddled together,
trying to retain that animal heat so necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>to our existence, to say nothing of our comfort.
A party of half-a-dozen of us gathered round a
fire of half-ignited logs of wood, trying, by every
means ingenuity could invent, to nurse it into
flame, and prevent the rain utterly drowning its
genial influence. We were sitting despondingly,
wet, and talking over our probable fate in the
morrow’s fight, when, by some unaccountable influence,
I put my hand into the side-pocket of
my grey great coat. I felt a something; I withdrew
my hand with a mingled feeling of joy and
fear; joy, occasioned by the unlooked-for discovery;
fear, from a dread of being disappointed
if I prosecuted my search without ultimate success;
when, having essayed again, to my great
delight, and to the envy of my companions, I
pulled out a cigar,—my last cigar! I seized
the half-ignited stick and applied it to the
weed,—alas! no smoke rewarded my efforts.
I cursed my folly for so carelessly exposing it
in my pocket: I rolled it and unrolled it; in
fact, I tried all the arts that smokers have invented
to doctor a bad cigar, when, after half-an-hour’s
patient endeavour, I elicited a blue
curling cloud from my last cigar. Happy moment!
Though years have intervened, never
have I forgotten that most ecstatic speck in the
few hours of terrestrial happiness I have met
with.’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“Poor fellow! How he must have enjoyed
it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt he did, boys! It recalls to my
mind not only the memorable plains of Waterloo,
but also many a camp-scene, wherein comforts
were scarce. It sets before me bygone struggles
in company with those who are now no
more. Vimiera, Corunna, Busaco, Salamanca,
and Vittoria, rise before me! To the memory
of many who fought and fell on Spanish ground,

<p class='c010'>“I will now tell you of the siege of Antwerp,
by far the most memorable siege of modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>times. But, first, a word or two on the
bombardment of Algiers, and of the taking of
Jean D’Acre. Algiers is on the coast of Africa.
It has many times been bombarded, for the deys,
or governors of the place, have usually been sad
pirates, taking the ships of all nations, and carrying
their crews and passengers into captivity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then they deserved to be punished for their
robbery and cruelty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When Admiral Keppel was sent to the Dey
of Algiers, to demand restitution of two ships
which the pirates had taken, he sailed with his
squadron into the bay of Algiers, and cast anchor
in front of the Dey’s palace. He then landed, and,
attended only by his captain and barge’s crew,
demanded an immediate audience of the Dey.
This being granted, he claimed full satisfaction for
the injuries done to the subjects of his Britannic
Majesty. Surprised and enraged at the boldness
of the admiral’s remonstrance, the Dey exclaimed,
‘that he wondered at the English King’s insolence
in sending him a foolish, beardless boy.’ A well-timed
reply from the admiral made the Dey forget
the laws of all nations in respect to ambassadors,
and he ordered his mutes to attend with the bowstring,
at the same time telling the admiral he
should pay for his audacity with his life. Unmoved
by this menace, the admiral took the
Dey to a window facing the bay, and showed
him the English fleet riding at anchor, and told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>him, that if he dared to put him to death there
were Englishmen enough in that fleet to make him
a glorious funeral-pile. The Dey was wise enough
to take the hint. The admiral obtained ample
restitution, and came off in safety.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The cruel Dey soon altered his tone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In consequence of a massacre, that took place
in 1816, of foreigners at Bona, then under the
protection of the British flag, Lord Exmouth was
ordered to Algiers to demand satisfaction of the
Dey for the insult offered to England.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There could be no satisfaction made to the
poor foreigners who were massacred.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; but had not the English interfered, the
Algerines might have done the same thing again
without fear. The flag of Lord Exmouth was
hoisted on board the Queen Charlotte, and the
expedition was joined at Gibraltar by a Dutch
squadron, under Vice-admiral Capellan. On Sunday,
the 25th of August, divine service was performed,
and prayers offered up for success in their
enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That must have been very solemn, as many of
them might never again meet on such an occasion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True. A flag of truce, with terms, was sent to
the Dey; and soon the Queen Charlotte came to
an anchor by the stern, at about ninety yards from
the muzzles of the guns of the mole-batteries. A
sailor always obeys flag-ship signals. You may be
sure, then, that the whole fleet soon drew up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>battle order. As it was evident the Algerines were
preparing to fire, the Queen Charlotte poured in a
broadside just as the smoke of one of the enemy’s
guns was visible. On went the work of destruction!
nor did it cease till the ships in the harbour
were destroyed, and the fortifications rendered a
heap of ruins. When the Dey found Algiers tumbling
about his ears he surrendered, and the whole
of the Christian slaves he had in captivity were
set free, and such slavery abolished for ever. The
French fitted out an expedition against Algiers a
few years ago, and took possession of it. They
are now practising great cruelties there, by what
they call <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">razias</span>, but what might more properly
be called, murderous inroads on the people. They
go forth with their troops to surprise the Arab
tribes; they burn their villages, destroy their harvests,
and slaughter men, women, and children.
O France! where is thy shame? Marshal Clauzel
asked the question of the French Senate, ‘If the
character of the inhabitants was such that the soil
could not be occupied without their destruction?’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do they kill the women and children?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They do; but they will not do it with impunity.
Algiers is draining France of her treasures
and troops. It may be called the French soldier’s
grave. There is an Eye above, boys, that marks
oppression and cruelty, and an Almighty arm to
chastise the oppressor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be shocking indeed, to act in that
cruel manner.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“St. Jean D’Acre is a strong place in Syria, on
the coast of the Mediterranean. The taking of
this strong fortress by the squadron under the
command of Admiral Sir Robert Stopford, after a
cannonade and bombardment of only a few hours,
is a most extraordinary affair, when we consider
that Sir Sidney Smith kept possession of this place
against every attempt of the French army under
Napoleon Buonaparte, to reduce it; though nine
assaults were made, by some of the bravest troops
in the world, on an open breach, it was all in vain.
Commodore Napier, one of the bravest men in the
British navy, commanded the Princess Charlotte,
Powerful, Bellerophon, Revenge, Thunderer, and
Pique, on an attack of the west lines of the works,
while the Edinburgh, Benbow, Castor, Carysfort,
Talbot, Wasp, and Hazard, attacked the south
face. The fire of the ships on both sides was fearfully
destructive. The Austrian frigate, Medea,
and the Guerriero, with the Arabian corvette,
Lipsia, did much service, as well as the Sultan’s
ship, Mookuddimay-i-hive. The steamers Gorgon,
Vesuvius, Phœnix, and Stromboli, threw shot and
shells into the town; and one shot, supposed to be
from the Gorgon, occasioned the destruction of the
powder-magazine. This explosion is said to have
almost annihilated two whole regiments, formed in
position on the ramparts; some say, more than a
thousand, and others, that nearer two thousand
were destroyed by it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Terrible! terrible!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may seem almost miraculous that the allied
fleet sustained so little injury, but this was principally
owing to a mistake made by the garrison.
Captain Boxer, and, I think, Captain Codrington, in
surveying the anchorage, discovered a shoal, of some
extent, opposite the wall, at the distance of about
two thousand yards, and as this was likely to injure
the shipping, a few buoys were placed to mark
the place. The garrison mistook the buoys for
moorings, and concluded that they marked out the
intended stations of the ships. Their guns were
accordingly elevated for that distance, and the
embrasures filled up with sand-bags, to fix the
elevation. This was a fatal error; for the fleet
came inside the buoys; and taking up a position
under the batteries, opened such a destructive fire
as left the garrison no opportunity to alter their
guns, or even to see their error, through the cloud
of smoke, which, wafted by a light breeze, thickened,
and hung like a dark canopy over the devoted
fortress. The shot of the garrison, for the most
part, passed over the hulls of the ships, only injuring
the sails and rigging, so that the whole amount
of killed and wounded, in a fleet of twenty-one
ships, drawn up within a few hundred yards of a
formidable battery, did not exceed three score
men. Some mischief was done on board the fleet
by the shells thrown by the garrison mortars, but,
during a fire of four hours, there was scarcely one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>shot in twenty from the heavy guns that did not
go over the hulls of the ships.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If it had not been for the mistake of the garrison,
one half of the British ships might have been
destroyed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They might. And we see, by this accident,
how by skill and tactics the commander of a fleet
might, in many cases, preserve his ships and men,
and gain a great advantage over his enemy. So
long as British men, in the army and navy, keep
up their present character for courage and discipline,
and are led on by commanders in whom they
have confidence, they will always rank as the
bravest of the brave. I was to tell you of the
siege of Antwerp. The general operations of a
siege shall be described, and then we will come to
Antwerp itself. You may remember what I said
about fortification, and the little that I told you
of a siege. Well, now I will be more particular in
my description.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now for it! How do they begin to fight?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The attack commences, not with the firing of
cannon, the throwing of shells, or by marching
soldiers up to the walls or ditch of the fortified
place, but with pickaxes and spades.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pickaxes and spades! What, do soldiers fight
with such weapons as these?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and very effectually too; but you shall
hear. The first thing to be done, is to dig a
trench, or ditch, parallel to the general outline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of the fortress, and at a distance of about six
hundred yards from it. The earth flung up out
of the trench forms a bank, or parapet, on the
side next to the enemy, and is, therefore, a defence
to the besiegers. You will remember, then, that
the first and most important object to be attained
in a siege, is to carry forward a trench up
to the walls of the place: the quicker this is
done the fewer lives will be lost on the part
of the besiegers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what is the ditch for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ditch is cut that batteries may be the
more safely erected there, to concentrate their
fire upon the part to be attacked. This ditch
is called the <i>first parallel</i>. The men and guns
are comparatively safe in the ditch, when they
would be swept away by the cannon of the
besieged, if they remained on the surface of the
ground.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! we see now; digging the ditch is a
capital plan. You told us about the first, and
the second, and the third parallel before, but we
shall understand you better now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From this trench, or first parallel, a ditch
is then cut, in a zigzag form, so as to get nearer
and nearer to the fortress by degrees. When this
has reached within the range of musketry, or
about three hundred yards from the place, another
trench is stretched out, parallel with the
first; and this is called the <i>second parallel</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“They are getting nearer to the place now;
but what are the soldiers in the fortress doing
all this time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thundering away with their guns, or making
sorties, and picking off men and officers where
they can. Well, on go the besiegers, working
night and day; darkness, cold, rain, toil, and
the fire of the enemy, trying them in every
way; patient, uncomplaining, and persevering, on
they go, cutting again in a zigzag form, till they
come to the foot of the glacis, or sloping bank
of earth of the fortress, and here they form
their <i>third parallel</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nearer still! There is no room now, however,
for another parallel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, they are too close for that. The next
step is to carry on the works up the glacis, on
the crest of which they form batteries to demolish
the defences, and open the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revêtements</span>, or walls
of masonry. They then push on their operations
across the ditch, into the very works of the
fortress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how do they cross the moat if it is full
of water?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They act according to circumstances. Sometimes
by escalade, which is a desperate attack
on the place, by means of ladders, to cross the
ditch with, and mount the ramparts without
waiting to carry on the regular works against
the place. If the ditch be muddy, they use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>boards, hurdles, and fascines. Fascines are faggots
of small wood, about a foot through them,
and, perhaps, six feet long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, suppose the moat is full of water, how do
they manage then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If they cannot draw off the water, they cross
it in small tin boats, or baskets covered with
skins or oil cloth, resorting to all manner of
contrivances. It is very necessary to find out
the strength of the enemy’s works, to know how
to act. When the French besieged Montmelian,
in 1691, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maréchal de Catinat</span> was in
doubt whether the ditch of the place was sunk
in the hard rock or only faced with masonry
on the side of the glacis. To clear up this
doubt, he caused soldiers to descend in a gabion,
or basket, suspended by a cord; but so many
brave men fell in this hazardous enterprize, that
at last no one was found who would undertake
it. After some time, a young soldier stepped
forward as a volunteer. He was asked by the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maréchal</span>, what course he intended to take in
ascertaining whether it was rock or masonry?
To which he replied, ‘that by probing it with
the point of his bayonet from the window of
the gabion, he should know it very well.’ He
descended on the daring commission he had undertaken,
executed it in a satisfactory manner,
and returned unhurt. ‘And now, what will you
have for a recompense?’ asked the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maréchal</span>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>‘I ask as a favour,’ replied he, ‘that I may
enter the company of grenadiers.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We thought he would have asked for money,
and a discharge. And was he made a grenadier?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may be sure of that, boys, after such
a bold action as he had done. The siege of
Antwerp is one of the most celebrated of modern
times. The fortress was unusually strong,
well garrisoned with Dutch soldiers, and provided
with plenty of ammunition; and old General
Chassé was a resolute and experienced
officer. On the other hand, Marshal Gerard, the
French general, was a celebrated commander, and
had an overwhelming force at his disposal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many men had he? and how many had
General Chassé?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The garrison amounted to between four and
five thousand men, and the fortress had a hundred
and thirty pieces of cannon. Marshal Gerard
had under his command fifty-one battalions,
fifty-six squadrons, and sixty-six field-pieces, besides
an immense battering train, with sappers,
miners, and engineers. Altogether the French
force amounted to more than sixty-six thousand
men, fourteen thousand horses, and two hundred
and twenty-three guns.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What an army! Why, there was no hope
for poor Chassé!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was a mortar, called the ‘Monster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Mortar,’ used by Marshal Gerard; and well
might it be so called, for the wood-work of it
alone weighed sixteen thousand pounds, and the
metal fourteen thousand seven hundred. The
shell it threw was two feet across it, and when
charged, weighed a thousand and fifteen pounds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was a monster mortar indeed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was, boys. I think there were, in all, eight
shells thrown from the Monster Mortar into the
citadel at Antwerp; one, not reckoned, burst in
the air, and of course did not reach its destination.
Every time one of these enormous shells, weighing
nearly half a ton, which looked like a small balloon
when in the air—for the burning fusee was visible
by daylight—every time one of these burst in the
citadel, a crowd of thoughtless Belgians raised a
shout. The volume of dust and smoke was like
the effect of a magazine blowing up. One of these
eight shells fell within twenty yards of the principal
powder-magazine, which contained about two
or three hundred thousand pounds weight of powder.
Had this been struck and blown up, there is
but little doubt that half the city of Antwerp, with
its celebrated cathedral, would have been destroyed.
Before the attack Chassé was summoned to
surrender, but he replied, ‘Never! He would first
be blown up in the citadel.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, he could never hope to beat sixty thousand
Frenchmen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From the time that Chassé opened his fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>there was no quiet night nor day. The French
returned the fire with near a hundred pieces of
artillery, and soldiers and miners, engineers and
artillery-men, were fully employed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt they had enough to do. It must
have been a terrible sight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Musket-shot, cannon-balls, and bombshells were
flying in all directions—rattling, roaring and bursting—night
and day, without intermission. Three
times did the Dutch soldiers make a sortie, but
they were beaten back. Three mines were sprung
by the besiegers, thousands of shot and shells were
thrown, and the fortress was in many places set
on fire. Old General Chassé held out bravely, but
he was driven to great distress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He should have surrendered. Where was the
use of his standing out against such an army?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did surrender, but not till he was reduced
to extremity. His well of water was almost dry,
his men diseased and worn out, his guns dismantled,
and his powder-magazine blown up. The
bomb-proof hospital, too, was set on fire, and the
blazing beams threatened to fall in upon his sick
soldiery. There was no hope left; and so the old
general gave up the place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! General Chassé could not have done
more. Why, the place was battered almost to
pieces!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was. The following are instances of the
gaiety of the French character:—On passing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>angle of the boyau, or branch of a trench, leading
into the second parallel, opposite St. Laurent, which
was partially enfiladed from kiel, an infantry soldier
was met, floundering through the mud under
the weight of a heavy gabion. A shot struck the
parapet, and, either from this or a false step, down
fell the man and his burden into the mire. One of
our countrymen would have risen, and his first
impulse would have been to have wished the besieged
and the service at a much hotter place than
the head of the sap; but the conscript sprung up,
shook himself, and exclaimed, with a smile, ‘Who
says it is not a fine thing to be a soldier? I’ll enlist
for ten years more from this day!’ and then,
hoisting up his load, on he went. On another occasion,
near the descent made in the ditch of the
ravelin, the adjutant of the trenches was writing
a memorandum: a shell pitched on the reverse of
the trench, exploded, and covered him and his
paper with a shower of sand. The officer slipped
it off quietly with his hand, and said, ‘They are
more polite than you, Messieurs; they sent me
the sand-box.’ A round shot struck a gabion
close to the Duke of Orleans, and buried itself in
the ground, within a few inches of his person. The
prince took off his hat, and bowing, said, ‘One
ought to be polite to new acquaintances.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems a very strange thing that any one
can have the heart to speak so in the very middle
of danger.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“I will tell you of a curious circumstance. During
the siege the theatre was converted into a place
for observing the operations. The building being
near Maline’s Gate, a sight might be obtained from
it of part of the bastions, trenches, and batteries.
The managers, therefore, profiting by the ardent
desire of strangers to witness the novel spectacle,
took off the roof of the building, and erected platforms
for the accommodation of the curious, publishing
the following handbill notice:—‘The public
is informed that places are to be procured at the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre des Variétés</span> at Antwerp, for seeing the
siege.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, did they make a show of the siege while
hundreds of poor fellows were being killed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such was the case; and it only shows how
coldly those who are selfishly wrapped up in their
own interest, can regard the ruin and destruction
of those around them. Always encourage, boys,
a disposition to think of others as well as yourselves,
to pity the distress that you cannot relieve,
and to practise when you can the principles of
humanity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell us something about the Duke of Wellington,
uncle; you must know a great deal about him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Almost everybody knows a great deal about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>him, but soldiers especially. I knew him when
he was a much younger man than he is now: the
soul of dispatch, the very spirit of enterprise.
And then, he mingled prudence with his military
ardour. Trace his progress all through his successful
career, and you will not find him cruel,
perfidious, and rapacious, as many of the French
generals were.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell us all you know about him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An able writer has eloquently said, ‘The
Duke of Wellington, Field Marshal of the allied
army, viz. the English, Spanish, and Portuguese
troops, has most eminently distinguished himself
in conducting the late war on the Continent,
which lasted five hard campaigns, during which
time it is remarkable, that no circumstances happened
which could throw a shade once over the
military glory of the country, or his own personal
character.’ It was a new feature, that this
great general had conducted these five campaigns
through such extraordinary difficulties, in the
face of the first armies of Europe, headed by
some of the greatest commanders which the
French Revolution had brought forth, and that
in every instance he should have been victorious.
The Field Marshal had inspired confidence in all
the nations whose troops he commanded, and
had risen to the highest command in their service;
and so active was he in his exertions that
he received the thanks of Parliament thirteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>different times for his distinguished victories and
great exploits, which have so mainly contributed
to the restoration of peace, and the happy deliverance
of Europe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wellington must be the first general in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The duke, whatever he may think of himself
now, used to much underrate his ability as a commander.
In the early part of his military life
often and often was he heard to say, ‘As for
my military talents, it is all a mistake; I have
none. Nature never intended me for a soldier,
but for a statesman.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wellington did not know himself in thinking
lowly of himself as a soldier.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has, indeed, proved himself to be the
champion of his country. The whole civilized
world was threatened with a Gallic usurpation,
and Great Britain found herself involved in a
struggle, from which she could scarcely, with
safety, withdraw. The question is, whether, if
the battle had not been fought on Spanish
ground, and in the Netherlands, it would not
have been fought on the hills and green valleys
of Old England? The battle of Waterloo was
a dreadful fight, and many were the brave fellows,
on both sides, who fell; but ever since
then, Peace has waved her olive-branch among us.
Who shall say this would have been the case
had not British warriors, strong in their strength,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>and mighty in the justice of their cause, entered
into the strife, and sternly grappled with their
haughty foeman? The victory obtained at Waterloo
was but one part of the conquest,—the
peace we have since enjoyed, is the other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must please to tell us more about the
Duke of Wellington.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The duke, notwithstanding the fame and
fortune he has acquired, is very simple in his
habits, sleeping at the present time in the same
narrow bed in which he reposed on the tented
field. It has no curtains, and is so narrow that
he has hardly room to turn round in it. But he
says, ‘when a man thinks of turning, it is time
he were up.’ I will give you an anecdote or
two of his conduct in battle, which, perhaps,
may never have reached you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“During the scene of tumult and carnage
which the battle of Waterloo presented, at
every moment, and in every place, the Duke of
Wellington exposed his person with a freedom
which made all around him tremble for that
life on which it was obvious that the fate of
the battle depended. There was scarcely a
square but he visited in person, encouraging the
men by his presence, and the officers by his
directions. While he stood in the centre of
the high road in front of Mount St. Jean, several
guns were levelled against him, distinguished
as he was by his suite, and the movements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of the officers, who were passing to and fro
with orders. The balls repeatedly grazed a tree
near him; when he observed to one of his suite,
‘That’s good practice; I think they fire better
than in Spain.’ Riding up to the 95th, when in
front of the line, and even then expecting a
formidable charge of cavalry, he said, ‘Stand
fast, 95th, we must not be beat; what will they
say in England?’ On another occasion, when
many of the best and bravest men had fallen,
and the event of the action seemed doubtful
to those who remained, he said, with the coolness
of a spectator, ‘Never mind, we’ll win
this battle yet.’ To another regiment, then
closely engaged, he used a common sporting expression:
‘Hard pounding this, gentlemen; let
us see who will pound longest.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He must have thought very well of his soldiers,
to put such confidence in them in the very
midst of the battle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One general officer found himself under the
necessity of stating to the duke, that his brigade
was reduced to one third of its numbers,
and that those who remained were so exhausted
with fatigue, that a temporary relief, of however
short duration, seemed a measure of necessity.
‘Tell him,’ said the duke, ‘what he proposes
is impossible. He, I, and every Englishman
in the field, must die on the spot we now
occupy.’ ‘It is enough,’ returned the general;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>‘I and every man under my command, are determined
to share his fate.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What determination there must have been
among them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“His Grace the Duke of Wellington gives an
annual banquet at Apsley House, in celebration
of the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo. At
this banquet the guests are chiefly the most distinguished
officers who fought in that memorable
battle, which hurled Napoleon Buonaparte for ever
from the throne of France, and sent him an exile
to St. Helena. The gold and silver services of
plate, and the china used on these occasions, are
very costly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We should like to see that banquet very
much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the eye of a soldier this banquet is a glorious
spectacle, for every beating heart around the festive
board has been, at one time or other,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Among the foremost in the proud array,</div>
      <div class='line'>The battle’s bulwark in the narrow way.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Clad in full uniform, and wearing all their decorations,
may be seen the illustrious duke and his
military companions. Again do they recall the
perils of the past; nor do they forget, among their
toasts, to give, ‘The memory of the heroes who fell
at Waterloo!’ and ‘The health of our brave companions
in arms!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please to tell us the names of some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>generals and officers that were with Wellington at
Waterloo?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There has been a splendid picture of the Waterloo
Banquet, painted by Salter. I have a list
of all the generals and officers that appear in the
painting, and, as it is altogether a national record,
if you like, I will read the list over to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, the names of all who were at the banquet!
That will be capital! Now for it, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall soon read it over, so pay attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you for reading us the list. The company
at the banquet, who fought at Waterloo, will
be getting less and less every year. Where is
Apsley House? we have often heard of it; no doubt
it is a grand place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Apsley House stands at the south-east entrance
of Hyde Park, and near it may be seen the
celebrated bronze statue of Achilles, erected in
honour of the Duke of Wellington. The mansion
is certainly a splendid one, though the strong musket-proof
iron gratings, which defend the windows,
are no ornament to it. Those gratings were placed
there because a rude assemblage of people once
threatened the duke, and demolished his windows.
Popularity with the people is a very uncertain
possession. The bronze palisading and gates in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>front are very strong. I can tell you a very curious
anecdote about Apsley House, which appeared in
the newspapers, if you should like to listen to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes! do let us hear it; we hope it is a
very long one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not very long, but, as I said, very curious.
As George II. was one day riding on horseback
in Hyde-park, he met an old soldier who had
fought with him in the battle of Dettingen. With
this soldier he entered into free discourse. After
talking together for some time, the King asked the
old veteran what he could do for him? ‘Why,
please your Majesty,’ said the soldier, ‘my wife
keeps an apple-stall on the bit of waste ground as
you enter the park, and if your Majesty would
be pleased to make us a grant of it, we might build
a little shed and improve our trade.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The request was a very moderate one, and was
at once granted. In a little time the old apple-woman
prospered greatly, for the shed was built,
and her business surprisingly increased. The situation
was a good one for the purpose, and she carried
on a very profitable trade.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the course of years the old soldier died,
and the lord-chancellor, who was looking around
him at the time for a suitable piece of ground
whereon he might build himself a mansion, fixed his
mind on this very spot. The old woman was sadly alarmed
when she saw her poor shed pulled down,
and preparations made for building up a great house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>where it stood, so away she went to her son, an
attorney’s clerk, to consult with him as to what
course should be pursued. The son was shrewd
enough to see at once the advantage that might be
gained by remaining quiet in the matter, so he
advised his mother to say nothing until the great
mansion should be completed. No sooner was the
house finished, than the son waited on the lord-chancellor
to complain of the trespass committed
on his mother’s property, and to claim a recompense
for the injury that had been sustained.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the chancellor saw that the claim was
undeniable, he directly offered a few hundred
pounds, by way of compensation; but this was
altogether refused; the old woman, advised by
her son, would by no means settle the affair on
such easy terms. After some deliberation, a
ground-rent of four hundred pounds a-year was
demanded, and his lordship at last agreed to
the terms. To this very day, Apsley House,
the mansion of the Duke of Wellington, yields
a ground-rent of four hundred pounds per year,
to the descendants of the old apple-woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There never was a more curious tale than
that, however! It was enough to make the old
apple-woman wild with joy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some few years ago two gentlemen waited
on the Duke of Wellington, at Apsley House,
and told him, that a friend of theirs had died,
leaving them executors to his will, in which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>among other bequests, he had left five hundred
pounds to the bravest man in the British army,
and that as they considered his Grace to be the
bravest man, they had called to hand over to
him a check for the money.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The duke was much pleased at the compliment
paid to him, but declined to receive
the money, as he said there were many other
men in the British army who equalled him in
bravery. He was then requested to decide on
whom the money should be bestowed. This
was a difficult point; but at length he proposed
it should be given to Major-General Sir James
Macdonnel, who so resolutely defended Hougomont,
the key to the British position, in the
memorable battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The two gentlemen then called on Major-General
Macdonnel, telling him the decision of
the Duke of Wellington, and tendering him the
five hundred pounds. But Sir James, in his turn,
declined to receive it, knowing, as he said, a
man who, in the battle of Waterloo, had showed
himself equal to any one in bravery. The major-general
then described, that when the French
troops made one of their rushes at the gates of the
farm-house, called Hougomont, in that critical
moment when victory and defeat hung evenly
in the balance, Sergeant-Major Frazer, a very
powerful man, boldly assisted him to close the
gates, thereby shutting out the French, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>were soon after driven back with great slaughter.
Thus was the fortune of the day decided.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Duke of Wellington considered Major
General Macdonnel deserving of the money, on
account of his resolute defence of Hougomont,
and Sir James considered that Sergeant-Major
Frazer, was entitled to share it with him, on account
of the great service he had rendered him
on that occasion. The money was divided between
the general and the sergeant-major, and
the generosity of the Duke of Wellington and Sir
James Macdonnel will not soon be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now please to tell us all that you know about
Buonaparte, for he was as fond of fighting as any
man.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“That is true. The history of Buonaparte, and
that of the Duke of Wellington, would be the
history of almost all great battles fought since
the French Revolution, fifty years ago; but you
shall have a sprinkling of such things as I can
remember of Buonaparte. Every soldier is pretty
well acquainted with the fame of the Emperor
Napoleon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They say, that he was not a Frenchman:
was he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was a Corsican; but as the island of
Corsica became, by law, a French department
two or three months before his birth, so he may
be called a Frenchman. Napoleon Buonaparte
was one of the greatest warriors of modern
times. For many years before his death he became
Emperor of the French.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great as he was, Wellington beat him!
Please to tell us something about him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When a boy, his principal plaything was a
brass cannon; and so fond was he of being alone,
that when he could do so, he retired to a solitary
summer-house among the rocks. The place is
now called ‘Napoleon’s Grotto.’ In after-life he
has been heard to say, that in childhood he was
remarkable for obstinacy, and curiosity. Others
say that he was high-spirited, quarrelsome, imperious,
fond of solitude, and a sloven in his dress.
One good thing I will tell you of him. He always
spoke gratefully of the kindness of his mother. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>was a saying of his, ‘The future good or bad
conduct of a child depends entirely on his mother.’
From Brienne, where he was for a time
educated, he was sent to the Royal Military
School of Paris.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! There he would learn everything about
war.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At sixteen years of age he was made second
lieutenant in a regiment of artillery, and seven
years after he became a captain. During the
French Revolution he took the command of a
battalion of national guards; and the first military
service he performed was against his own
country, Corsica.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was a bad beginning, to fight against
his country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall tell you about some of the battles in
which he was afterwards engaged, but will now
only give you a few anecdotes about him. Some of
them are against him, and some in his favour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is the fairest way, to let us know both
sides of the question.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the age of twenty-six Buonaparte assumed
the command of the army of Italy! ‘You are
too young,’ said one of the directors, who hesitated
about his appointment as general. ‘In a
year,’ replied Napoleon, ‘I shall be either old
or dead.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He seems to have had a great deal of spirit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Soldiers!’ said he, to the army under his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>command, ‘you are hungry and naked: the
Republic owes you much, but she has not the
means to pay her debts: I am come to lead
you into the most fertile plains that the sun
beholds. Rich provinces, opulent towns, all shall
be at your disposal. Soldiers! with such a prospect
before you, can you fail in courage and
constancy?’ This was the first address he made
to his army, and it ran like lightning from
rank to rank. The men, who before were downhearted,
became animated with hope and confidence,
and the most distinguished officers of
France, from that moment, determined to follow
their youthful leader, as one who would assuredly
lead them to victory and renown. Massena,
Joubert, Augereau, Serrurier, and Lannes,
were among them; though their well-tried courage
and experience might have justified them
in seeking the supreme command, yet they
cheerfully followed one whom they were fully
convinced, would be successful in his daring enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was just the man for the French, then,
for he knew how to call up their courage. But
six-and-twenty must have been a young age for
a general?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When Buonaparte was in his prosperity he
employed, it is said, the same trades-people who
supplied him in his former days. A silversmith,
who had given him credit, when he set out for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Italy, for a dressing-case, worth fifty pounds, was
rewarded with all the business which his recommendations
could bring to him; and being clever
in his trade, he became, under the patronage of
the emperor, one of the wealthiest citizens of
Paris. A little hatter, and a cobler, who had
served Buonaparte when a subaltern, might have
risen in the same manner, had their skill equalled
that of the silversmith. Napoleon’s example,
however, could not persuade the good people of
Paris to wear ill-shaped hats and clumsy boots;
but he, in his own person, adhered to the last to his
original connexion with these poor trades-people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is very much to his credit, whatever
might be his faults.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is, and we should act honestly when
speaking of the character of an enemy. The
British army and navy have furnished instances
of this kind. Courage and fidelity frequently go
together, so that the soldier or sailor, who is
the <i>first</i> to <i>face</i> the cannon’s mouth, is often the
<i>last</i> to <i>turn his back</i> on a friend. Buonaparte,
once apprehensive that his generals were on the
point of breaking into open mutiny, threw himself
suddenly among them, and addressing the
tallest of them in a threatening vehement tone,
said, ‘You have been talking sedition: take
care lest I fulfil my duty: your five feet ten
inches would not hinder you from being shot
within two hours.’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“That was enough to make the general that he
spoke to tremble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One of the blackest stains on the reputation
of Buonaparte, is the massacre at Jaffa. Twelve
hundred, some say nearly three thousand Turks,
a part of the garrison of the place, surrendered.
These were marched to some sand-hills, at a little
distance from the town, and there, being divided
into small parties, every man was shot or bayonetted.
Not all the waters of the green ocean would ever
wash that dark blot from Napoleon’s brow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shocking! shocking! That is a black mark
on his brow indeed. There are quite enough soldiers
fall in battle, but to shoot men when the
battle is over is dreadful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is no true soldier who covers the name
of an enemy with the slime of slander, but the
truth must be spoken when it condemns as well
as when it approves. The murder of the Duke
d’Enghein, for murder it may properly be called,
was another of the black acts of Buonaparte. The
duke was surprised in his castle, hurried off to the
citadel of Strasburgh, called up at midnight three
days after, taken to Paris, and then to the Castle
of Vincennes, hastily tried, and condemned, and
afterwards shot in the ditch of the castle by torchlight.
The seizure, trial, and condemnation, were
all contrary to the laws of France.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Duke d’Enghein!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Buonaparte was a man of great parts and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>much energy, but self was the centre of all he did,
though many of his acts appear to manifest a love
of his country. He instituted the famous legion
of honour: every Frenchman is proud of it. The
decoration of the legion of honour was given to
those who performed any meritorious service,
whether in the army or out of it. A common
soldier could obtain it as well as a general. It
entitles the wearer to certain precedence, and a
pension. Napoleon, when made First Consul, was
much thinner than in his after life. I have seen a
picture of him, wherein he appeared to be taller
and altogether a different kind of man to what he
was when he became somewhat corpulent. Buonaparte
threatened to invade England, but the attempt
was never made, though he assembled one
hundred thousand troops, and an immense flotilla
of flat-bottomed boats, to bear them across the
channel. If war can be justified at one time more
than another, it is when a country is invaded.
The British spirit rose at once, so that, besides the
regular troops, and militia of the country, three
hundred and fifty thousand volunteers were soon
in arms. On this occasion Sir Walter Scott wrote
his song to the Edinburgh volunteers. One of the
verses runs thus:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sheridan said, that the first vision of Buonaparte
in the morning, was the destruction of England,
and that his last prayer at night, whether
he addressed it to Jupiter, or to Mahomet, to the
goddess of battle, or the goddess of reason, was
to bring about the same end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a good thing the French gave it up.
There would have been sad work of it. Do you
think they would have conquered us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Conquered us! no, boys. Thousands, and tens
of thousands might have been slain, but they could
never have crushed the spirit of liberty out of
British hearts. If Englishmen can fight as they
do out of their country, what would they not do
in it rather than be conquered. It was, as you
say, a good thing that the invasion was given up;
but, if the French had persevered, our blue-jackets
in the British Channel, and our red-coats on the
coasts, would have found them enough to do both
by water and land. The one and the other would
have joined in the chorus,</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Rule, Britannia!</div>
      <div class='line'>Britannia rules the waves!</div>
      <div class='line'>Britons never shall be slaves!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“But we are forgetting Buonaparte. He styled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>a part of his troops the Invincibles; but they were
no more invincible than the Spanish Armada,
which had the same name. British soldiers, under
General Abercrombie in Egypt, first defeated the
French Invincibles, and Wellington afterwards,
scattered them like a flock of sheep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must tell us about the battle of Waterloo;
and then we shall hear how his Invincibles met
British men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ought not to forget a proof of the generous
conduct of Buonaparte on one occasion. It was
when he had taken Berlin, the Prussian capital.
The Prince of Hatzsfeld, while under his protection,
corresponded with the Prussian general, sending
him an account of the movements of the French.
One of his letters being intercepted, the prince
was arrested; when his wife, thinking her husband
not guilty, gained access to the emperor, and boldly
asserted his innocence. Napoleon handed to her
the prince’s letter: when she fell, in silence and
despair, on her knees. ‘Put the paper in the fire,’
said Napoleon, ‘and there will then be no proof of
guilt.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! that was a noble action. What a pity that
he did not perform more such actions!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In taking the bridge and town of Montereau,
Buonaparte was seen pointing cannon with his own
hand, under the heaviest of the fire. But though
this delighted the artillery-men, they expressed great
apprehension at his personal danger. ‘My children,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>said he, still persisting in his employment,
‘the bullet that shall kill me is not yet cast.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was, no doubt, a very bold man, but it
was very presumptuous to talk in that way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most likely his object was to encourage his
soldiers. The famous battle of the Pyramids was
one in which Buonaparte obtained much reputation
as a soldier. He had a strong frame, and
could endure much. While other generals put
on light clothing, and were bathed in perspiration,
beneath the burning sun of Egypt, he wore
his uniform, as usual, buttoned up to the chin.
He was the last at night to fling his body, wrapt
in his war-cloak, on the ground, and the first in
the morning to spring up from slumber. When he
came within sight of the pyramids he cried out,
‘Soldiers! from the summit of yonder pyramids
forty ages behold you!’ The rage of the battle
then broke loose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On came the Mamelukes, with their fiery
steeds. Strong and rapid in their movements,
they raised a wild cry, and rushed on the bristling
bayonets of the French, who were drawn up
in squares. They tried to force a passage, urged
their horses on, and then backed them against
their enemies. But the French would not give
way. The Mamelukes were almost mad with
rage; they dashed their carbines and pistols in
the faces of the French soldiers, and, when
wounded on the ground, cut at their legs, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>it was all in vain. The French cannon and
musketry mowed them down;—they fell back!
The carnage was dreadful! The battle was won
by Napoleon. Cairo soon surrendered to him, and
he became the conqueror of Lower Egypt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The taking of the bridge of Lodi, in Italy,
was one of the most daring achievements of
Buonaparte. This bridge was a wooden one; and
a battery of thirty cannon was so placed as to
sweep it completely. The whole Austrian army
was drawn up behind it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Napoleon Buonaparte was not to be intimidated
by danger, he advanced, and a furious
cannonade broke forth. Buonaparte rushed on
in the middle of the fire, and pointed two guns
with his own hands, so as to prevent the Austrians
approaching the bridge to blow it up. His
soldiers were delighted at his bravery, and called
him ‘<i>The Little Corporal</i>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Napoleon gave the word, and a column of
grenadiers rushed to the bridge, shouting ‘Vive
la Republique!’ The grape-shot swept them down
terribly. They hesitated,—Buonaparte hurried to
their head, with Lannes, Berthier, and Lallemaque,
and cheered them onward. The cannon raged, a
tempest of shot was around them, but they dashed
on. The artillery-men were bayonetted at their
guns; the bridge of Lodi was taken, and the
Austrian army scattered in confusion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Buonaparte was a brave man, no doubt, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>he seemed to delight in war. He must have
seen the death of many in his time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will hardly bear thinking of. It is said,
that during his wars, four millions of men, must
have fallen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Four millions of men! It is very well there
are not many Buonapartes in the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was too fond of fighting; and after all his
victories he got no good by them. If half the
world had been his, he would never have been
contented till he had obtained the other half.
Ambition was the ruin of him:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He saw, though visible to him alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ambition, seated on a shining throne:—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Cut through yon glittering host,’ she loudly cries.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Behold me here, ordained the victor’s prize!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“There was never a braver man than Buonaparte
in the world. He cared no more for cannon-shot
than we do for snow-balls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Napoleon showed a daring and invincible
spirit in crossing the Alps, and in numberless
battles, but, perhaps, never did he manifest more
true courage than in throwing himself fearlessly
into the arms, as it were, of the French army,
on his return from Elba, where, after his abdication,
he had been a prisoner. A battalion was
sent against him. He dismounted from his horse,
and advanced alone, opening his surtout so as
to show the star of the legion of honour; and
crying out, ‘If there be among you a soldier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>who desires to kill his general—his Emperor—let
him do it now! Here I am!’ The whole battalion
shouted ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</span>’ and instantly
joined him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, if he had had as many lives as some
people say a cat has, he seemed to take the
very way to lose them all, and yet he always
escaped.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A celebrated writer has said, ‘It is impossible
to survey the rapid energy of Napoleon, his
alert transitions from enemy to enemy, his fearless
assaults on vastly superior numbers, his unwearied
resolution and exhaustless invention, without the
highest admiration which can attend on a master
of warfare. But it is equally impossible to suppress
astonishment and indignation, in following,
or rather attempting to follow, the threads
of obstinacy, duplicity, pride, and perfidy, which
during the same period complicated, without
strengthening, the tissue of his negotiations.’ It
is only when we fix our eyes on the battles and
marches of his wonderful campaigns, that we can
hesitate to echo the adage: ‘Whom God hath
doomed to destruction he first deprives of reason.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! he is dead now, and that is a good
thing. If he were Emperor of France now, we
should be sure to have as much war as ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Buonaparte’s campaign in Russia was a most
disastrous one, and led the way to his abdication;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>but it was the battle of Waterloo that deprived
him of his throne for ever. This hurled him headlong
from the pinnacle of his glory, proclaiming,
as with the voice of a mighty trumpet, through
the world, that the minion of ambition shall be
trampled in the dust, and that the splendour of
temporary triumph shall only increase the greatness
of his fall. He was exiled to St. Helena,
where, after living near six years, he expired, and
was buried. His body was, however, a short time
ago, removed to France, and interred, with great
splendour, in the Church of the Invalids, at Paris.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The 18th of October is a remarkable day, as
connected with Napoleon Buonaparte.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In what way is it remarkable?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was on the 18th of October that the revolution
took place which made him consul. It
was on the 18th of October that he fought the
battle of Torlina, on the Berezina. It was on
the 18th of October that he fought the battle of
Leipsic. It was on the 18th of October that

18th of October that the French ship La Belle

<p class='c010'>“We want to know who are the highest officers
in the army and navy. They are generals and
admirals, are they not, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“The highest officer is the King himself—when
there is a king on the throne of England. And the
virtues in his heart ought ever to exceed in value
the jewels of his crown. He is captain-general of
all the forces of Great Britain, the head of all
rank, power, and authority. Under him come the
commander-in-chief, at the head of the army, and
the lord-high-admiral at the head of the navy; but
generally the office of lord-high-admiral is filled
by commissioners, under the name of the lords of
the admiralty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is a field-marshal? Wellington is called
a field-marshal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he is a field-marshal, and when an army
is in the field, a field-marshal is the highest officer
among them, he takes the command of them all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there any other field-marshal in the army
besides the Duke of Wellington?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes! several. The King of Hanover, the
Duke of Cambridge, and the King of the Belgians,
are all field-marshals in the British army; and
there is another too, Prince Albert.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what is the next rank to a field-marshal?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A general. There are many of these in the
army, for though every field-marshal is a general,
every general is not a field-marshal. A general is
a chief officer in the army, to whom the command
of soldiers has been entrusted by the sovereign or
the senate of a country. The commander-in-chief, of
course, ranks first. If a general have not a martial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>genius, a sound judgment, and a healthy constitution,
united with intrepidity, self-possession, business-like
habits, and goodness of heart, he is not
equal to the duties of his station. A young general
will lack experience and prudence, and an old
general will hardly be sufficiently energetic and
active. The next in rank to a general is a lieutenant-general,
and then come the major-general
and the brigadier-general.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a sight it would be to see all the Field-marshals
and generals and colonels together!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would indeed, especially to a soldier. A
colonel is the commander of a regiment, whether
of horse, foot, dragoons, or artillery, and a lieutenant-colonel
is next in rank. They should be
men of talent and resolution, for their duties are
very important, and good officers often make good
soldiers. Next to the lieutenant-colonel come the
major, adjutant, and sergeant-major. The drum
and fife-majors are at the head of the drummers
and fifers, and instruct others in their duty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have not told us what a captain is, and
surely he comes before the drummers and fifers,
though he does not make half the noise that they
do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A captain is a commander either of a troop
of horse, or of a company of foot or artillery. In
marching or fighting, at the head of his company,
he is much looked up to by his men. If he be not
every inch a soldier, it is soon found out by the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>under his command. It is his business both to
march and fight at the head of his company.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The lieutenant comes next to the captain?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He does. The name lieutenant is French,
<i>lieu-tenant</i>—holding the place of another. After
the lieutenant come the ensign and cornet: the
former carries the standard in a company of foot,
and the latter in a troop of horse. An ensign is
the lowest commissioned officer in a company of
foot; after him come the sergeant and corporal.
Buonaparte was called by his soldiers, ‘The Little
Corporal.’ There are other posts of authority beside
what I have mentioned, for the discharge of
particular duties. Every officer is as liable to
punishment if he break the articles of war, as a
common soldier is; and then, if a superior officer
act improperly to the officers beneath him, they
sometimes send him a round-robbin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what is a round-robbin? Do tell us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A Frenchman told me that the name came
from ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruban rond</span></i>,’ which means a round riband.
When officers wish to send a remonstrance in
writing to one above them, instead of writing
their names one under the other, they write them
in a round form, so that no one can tell who signed
the paper first. It is a kind of honourable agreement
into which they enter among themselves,
every one taking an equal share in the transaction.
But round-robins are not often to be seen. I
should have told you, that a quarter-master is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>officer whose duty it is to see after the quarters
of the soldiers, together with their food, clothing,
fuel, and ammunition. A quarter-master-general
is a considerable officer; and is required to know
well the country where he is, having to mark the
marches and encampments of the army.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have made us understand the different
ranks very well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That being the case, I must give you another
of my military sayings. A <i>private</i> should be proud
of his <i>general</i> good character. A <i>staff</i>-officer should
<i>lean</i> on nothing but his merit. The <i>major</i> part of
a <i>captain’s</i> duty is the care of his company. A
<i>quarter</i>-master should do <i>the whole</i> of his duty, and
the highest <i>officer</i> in the army should remember
that he is but a <i>man</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Capital! capital! We shall not forget that,
you may depend upon it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It sometimes happens that good soldiers are
obliged to take up with very bad quarters. Officers
themselves are, at times, very slenderly provided
for—in such cases, and indeed in all others, a good
temper, and a good stock of patience, are excellent
things. I will give you an instance of the good
temper, steadiness, and fortitude of an officer’s
daughter, Miss Elizabeth Smith, when deprived of
common comforts. This young lady had taught
herself, with little assistance, the French, Italian,
Spanish, German, Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages,
and somewhat of the Arabic and Persic:—she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>was the daughter of Captain Smith;
and her mother gives the following account:—We
had spent three happy weeks at the hospitable
mansion of Lord Kingston, from whence we set
off on horseback for our quarters, which were about
twenty miles distant. During the last ten miles
of the journey it rained most heavily, and without
ceasing. We arrived at the barracks dripping
wet; our luggage was not come, and, owing to the
negligence of the quarter-master, there was not
even a bed to rest on. The whole furniture of our
apartments consisted of a piece of a cart-wheel for
a fender; a bit of iron, probably from the same
vehicle, for a poker; a dirty deal table, and three
wooden-bottom chairs. It was the first time we
had joined the regiment; and I was standing at the
fire, meditating on our forlorn state, and perhaps
dwelling too much on the comforts we had lost,
when I was roused from my reverie by my daughter
Elizabeth, exclaiming, ‘Oh! what a blessing!’
‘Blessing!’ I replied, ‘there seems none left.’ ‘Indeed
there is, my dear mother, for see, here is a
little cupboard.’ I dried my tears, and endeavoured
to learn fortitude from my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good! That young lady had a very
happy temper, or she would not have been so
pleased with only a cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have told you of the ranks of the officers of
the army only. The officers of the navy are divided
into flag-officers; captains who command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>post-ships; commanders who command sloops;
lieutenants, and sub-lieutenants. But I had better
tell you how officers rank with one another in the
army and navy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But there are lower ranks than these: midshipmen
on board ship, and sergeants and corporals
among soldiers?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, there are. The officers in a ship under
a lieutenant are, the sub-lieutenant, master, second
master, gunner, boatswain, carpenter, master’s-mate,
and midshipman. And the officers in
the army under the captain, as I have already told
you, are, the lieutenant, ensign, sergeant and corporal.
If you can remember all I have said, it will
be a proof that you are not deficient in memory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean by the admiral of the
red?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An admiral who carries a red flag. I have
said something of admirals’ flags before, but will
be a little more particular now. Flag-officers are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>of three ranks: admirals, vice-admirals, and rear-admirals;
and each rank is divided into three
squadrons, distinguished by different coloured flags;
so that there are, besides the admiral of the fleet,
the commander-in-chief, admirals of the red, of
the white, and of the blue; vice-admirals of the
red, of the white, and of the blue, and rear-admirals
of the red, of the white, and of the blue.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if three sorts of admirals carry a red flag,
how do you know one from another?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the situation of the flag. The admiral of
the fleet carries an Union Flag at the main-top-gallant-mast
head, so that you may always know
his ship. Then, other admirals carry their flags,
let the colour be what it may, also at the main-top-gallant-mast
head. The vice-admirals carry
theirs at the fore-top-gallant-mast head, and the
rear-admiral carries his at the mizen-top-gallant-mast
head.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, oh, that is it! Then we know at last
what is the meaning of ‘the red flag at the fore.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that must be now pretty plain to you.
The marines are a very efficient part of the British
force; they are not to be out-done either in courage
or patriotism. For some time in my younger days
I belonged to them, and it was then that I picked
up what knowledge of nautical tactics I possess.
Had not a handful of British marines stood in the
breaches made by the soldiers of Buonaparte in
the garrison of St. Jean D’Acre in the year 1799,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>and thereby called up a spirit of determination in
the Turkish troops, the place must have surrendered.
As it was, it held out, baffled Buonaparte
with his bravest and his best, and rendered the
repulse of the French, and the bravery of Sir Sidney
Smith famous in history.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What have the marines to do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are trained to fight either on shore or
on board ships; and oftentimes they make sad
havoc among the enemy from the poop and the
round-top. When a ship is boarded by an enemy,
they sweep the decks with their muskets, or keep
back the boarders with their bayonets. I knew
some famous fellows among them, who were well

seaman, and would run a boat through the water
as if it were a catamaran.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is a catamaran, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A catamaran is a species of boat used by the
native Indians on the coast of Coromandel. It
consists of only one plank, five feet long and two
wide, on which the intrepid Indian kneels, and by
means of a paddle propels himself along through
the most terrific surf, bidding defiance to the warring
of the elements and the overwhelming seas,
which often hurl him from his perilous position,
but which he as quickly and dexterously regains;
and thus these amphibious beings afford communication
with ships in distress, when no other boat
could possibly live.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eight hundred and fifty in one ship!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, boys; and there were, perhaps, a thousand
people on board the Royal George when she
went down at Spithead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dreadful! dreadful! How did it happen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you, as well as I can. The ships
in the royal navy are sheathed with copper. The
Royal George, the flag-ship of Admiral Kempenfeldt,
a first-rate, of a hundred and eight guns,
had just returned from a cruise, and required some
repairs in her sheathing and water-pipe. To do
these repairs it was necessary to run her heavy
furniture to one side, and tilt her up, or to give her
what shipwrights call the parliament-heel. When
the ship was in this position, with her crew, and
at least three hundred women on board,—for the
vessel was crowded with friends to welcome home
the crew,—when the ship was in this position a
sudden squall, it is thought, came on,—though I
fear one of the lieutenants was sadly in fault,—and
over she tipped; down went the Royal George,
with the admiral, officers, crew, and all that were
aboard!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a terrible accident!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“It was indeed a very terrible one! Seamen
are usually very steady in storms and dangers, but
the crew of the Royal George foundered without
warning. You shall have an instance of the resolution
of seamen in a storm. The following relation
is given by a young officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The dead-lights were shipped, our hatches
were battened down, and eight men stationed to
the relieving tackles in the gun-room. At this
period the sea was tremendously heavy, the ship
rolling her quarter-deck bulwarks under, although
going at the rate of twelve and a half knots per
hour; the wind howled most dreadfully, and,
altogether, it was a most dismal sight to behold
our ship’s company shivering with cold and rain,
not able to procure any refreshment, the sea having
soon washed out the galley fire; and it was impossible
to get at the spirit-room to splice the mainbrace;
altogether it was truly miserable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘About three <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> the fore-sail, although furled,
was blown away from the yard, and shortly
afterwards the larboard main-top-sail sheet went,
and the sail flapped furiously against the top-mast
and main-mast head. At this critical juncture the
spirit of the British seaman was evinced; for, unless
the sail was cut away, the main-mast must be
lost, and, as a necessary consequence, the vessel
herself would have a bad chance, if broached to the
wind. It was a moment of terrible suspense and
anxiety to all hands, not one of whom could stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>or move on deck without holding on by the lifelines,
passed fore and aft; and even thus, two men
had been washed overboard, who were standing near
the main-mast, and, strange to relate, the next sea
washed them in again, the bight of the fore-sheet
having caught them; but one had his neck terribly
cut.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘In this extremity the captain had too much
feeling and humanity to order any men aloft, as it
was deemed impossible for them to succeed, and
that their lives must be inevitably sacrificed in
making the attempt; however, the gunner, Mr.
Collier, who had served as chief gunner’s mate of
the Shannon, in her splendid action with the Chesapeake,
and two seamen, whose names deserve to
be handed down to posterity, immediately volunteered
their services. It was a moment of extreme
dread and anxiety, to behold these gallant fellows
mounting the shrouds at a period when the sea
broke over our lower yard-arms, and every roll
of the ship threatened to consign them to eternity.
Each man on deck felt as if his own life were at
stake: when one of them, William Murray, the
captain of the main-top, laid out and cut away the
larboard earing, while the gunner, assisted by the
other, whose name I regret at this distant period
I cannot bring to memory, severed the remaining
top-sail sheet from the main-yard: the sail rent
asunder with a terrible crash, which was heard far
above the howling of the wind. The safety of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>vessel thus assured, what a joyous moment for
these brave and daring fellows, as they descended
to receive the heartfelt cheers and gratulations of
their officers and shipmates, as fine a crew as ever
trod a vessel’s deck: it was a scene not to be soon
forgotten, and calculated to inspire confidence in
the resources of British seamanship, and courage
under the most trying circumstances.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may never have heard, boys, the tread of
a thousand men, all putting down their feet to the
ground at the same moment? There is something
arresting and awful in it—it goes to the heart at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>once. Whether marching on the hard ground or
on the soft green sod, in either case there is no
other sound like it, that I know of in the world.
The earth seems to shake beneath it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, when a whole regiment march together
they must make a fine tramping.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not so much the noise they make, as it
is the particular sound that I allude to; a lone,
dull, heavy, and ponderous tread. A soldier distinguishes
it from every other sound in an instant.
Some regiments have excellent bands; but trumpets,
bugles, drums and fifes, are the prevailing
musical instruments in the army. The spirit-stirring
voice of the trumpet, the stormy music of the
rattling drum, and the blast of the mellow bugle,
sound grateful in a soldier’s ears. The kettle-drums
of the life-guards are silver, presented by
King William IV.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of silver! Why, what a deal of money they
must be worth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The kettle-drum belonging to the royal regiment
of artillery would surprise you. It is
mounted on a very superb waggon, richly gilt,
whereon is a seat for the drum-major-general,
and it is drawn by four, and sometimes by six,
richly caparisoned white horses.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They must look very grand indeed. Can you
tell us why drummers and fifers wear such odd
dresses? Their coats and jackets are very different
to what are worn by other soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“I have heard that these odd dresses were originally
intended to prevent military musicians from
playing in public houses, as they used to do when
they wore plain clothes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! oh! If they went into public houses
to play now, every one would know them directly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The qualities in British soldiers that recommend
themselves to all, may be said to be cleanliness,
order, obedience, fidelity, and invincible courage;
to which, among the officers, may be added
enterprize, and that quality so susceptible of injury
and disgrace, and so emulous of reputation,
called honour. The love of country is strong in
almost every bosom, from the recruit to the commanding
officer. The Egyptians idolize the Nile,
and the Hindoos worship the Ganges, but their
reverence and affection for their native rivers is
hardly greater than what is felt by the Germans
for the Rhine. When the armies of Austria and
Prussia came in view of the Rhine, after beating
back the invader of their country Napoleon Buonaparte,
they fell down on their knees, and shouted,
as with the voice of one man, ‘The Rhine!
the Rhine!’ Englishmen love their country as
much as the Germans love the Rhine!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Every one ought to love his country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, boys! while you can pronounce her name,
so long as your hearts throb, and the ruddy drops
run through your veins, love your country!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“Whether we are soldiers or not, we ought to
do that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very true; and I hope you will find means to
serve her without unscabbarding a sword in her
cause. True courage is not confined to the army
and navy; though cowardice is one of the blackest
marks that can be set on the brow of a soldier or
a sailor. Admiral Byng was shot at Portsmouth,
suspected of cowardice, though he had given many
proofs of determined courage. The second regiment
of native cavalry fled before the Affghan
horse, in the affair of Parwun Durra, in Kohistan,
changing, as it were, a triumph into a scene of
humiliation. The government of India could not
brook this dishonour without visiting it with its
heaviest displeasure. Lord Auckland directed
that the dastardly troops and officers should be
disgraced, by obliterating the number of their regiment
from the roll of the army, by expelling
them ignominiously from the service, and by declaring
them for ever incapable of serving the state
in any capacity whatever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would never do for soldiers and sailors to
want courage. Do you think Admiral Byng was
really a coward?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I do not think he was. He met his end
with great resolution, and that was not cowardly.
The following inscription to his memory may be
read in the church of South Hill, Bedfordshire:
‘To the perpetual disgrace of public justice, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Honourable John Byng, vice-admiral of the blue,
fell a martyr to political persecution on March
14th, 1757, when bravery and loyalty were insufficient
securities for the life and honour of a
naval officer.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, now, that was very hard. Poor Byng!
What he must have felt as a brave man, on being
shot for a coward!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cowardice is not often to be found in the British
army and navy. Even in merchant ships
courage abounds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are thousands and thousands of ships
on the sea, are there not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, the ships of Old England, in her Majesty’s
service, and the merchantmen, sailing from
the east to the west, from the north to the south,
would indeed astonish you, could you see them assembled.
Long may commerce flourish, and the
British flag be unfurled with honour in every part
of the world.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>‘What a night on the globe would prevail,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How forlorn each blank region would be,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Nor the keel cleave the fathomless sea!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“When speaking of courage, I might have told
you of the daring intrepidity of a seaman, but
I will tell you now. When his Majesty’s ship
Tonnant was in close action with the French
rear-admiral’s ship Algesiras, the latter had her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>bowsprit over the chess-tree of the former, so as
to admit of a raking fire from the Tonnant, which
did great mischief to the enemy. The fore-top
of the Algesiras was full of French riflemen, who
commanded, by an incessant fire, the upper decks
of the Tonnant, which the marines on the poop,
and officers and men on the quarter-deck were
suffering from considerably. In the midst of this
carnage an ordinary seaman, named Fitzgerald,
made his way from the main rigging of the
Tonnant, by the sprit-sail-yard of the enemy, to
the bowsprit of the Algesiras, and with his knife
cut down the French jack, amidst the loud cheers
of his shipmates and the shouts and groans of
the Frenchmen. Notwithstanding the heavy fire
of musketry, and many hand-grenades thrown
out of the fore-top of the enemy, he had regained
the main rigging of the Tonnant, where
his gallant exploit terminated from a grenade,
which struck him in the back: he sunk between
the two ships, with the tri-coloured winding-sheet
under his arm, accompanied by the admiration
and regret of every officer and man in the ship.
This fine fellow was an Irishman, of the humblest
origin; but the greatest man of the great house of
Fitzgerald never displayed more intrepidity or coolness
in the hour of danger than this poor Fitzgerald
did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was indeed a bold fellow! When ships
are out at sea looking about for the enemy, how
do they manage?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“Seamen, under the orders of the lieutenant,
are kept at the mast-heads during the day, and
in proper stations during the nights, to be continually
on the look-out; and if a stranger, that is,
an unknown sail, should be seen in the night, the
captain has intelligence of it directly, for a midshipman
is sent to him by the lieutenant, who is
to prepare the ship for action, taking care that the
vessel is kept out of gun-shot of the strange ship
until all is ready for an engagement. In doing this
he must be sure not to run any risk of losing sight
of the stranger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When an enemy’s ship is seen, no doubt there
is a pretty bustle on board.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you mean that the hands are pretty busy,
you are right; but there is very seldom any confusion
on board a king’s ship on the sight of an
enemy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what is done by sailors when they see an
enemy’s ship?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They give chase, and when they come up with
her, prepare for the battle. In the orders given
by the admiral there is often some pithy expression,
to animate the men, such as that given by
Nelson: ‘<i>England expects every man to do his
duty!</i>’ or, ‘<i>No captain can do wrong who places his
ship alongside of an enemy.</i>’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! Those are likely to make men fight, if
anything will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“After taking up stations, finding the sails, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>clearing for action, the pause sometimes is an awful
one, but the roar of the first broadside puts a different
face on the matter. The thundering peals
rapidly follow one another, and there is no going
to sleep till the battle is ended.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be terrible work; and there can be
no running away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; that is quite out of the question: British
sailors are not of the running sort. Just before
the battle begins, you may see men stripping themselves
to their duck-frocks for more liberty of limb,
some girdling their loins and binding their heads
with a neckcloth of black silk, and here and there
one with a bandage round his left knee; and you
hear the captain sing out to those descending the
shrouds, ‘Quick, my hearties, to your guns!’ or,
‘Now, my lads! down to the main deck and fire
away!’ The men give a cheer, off go the guns;
the deafening sound and stunning recoil of the
ship thrill through your heart. The cannonade
goes on—crash! crash! crash! and clouds of
smoke rise up, hiding from view the ships of the
enemy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can fancy ourselves in the battle; and it
is very dreadful!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you have time to snatch a glance at the
men, you will see that some are flushed, some pale,
and some press their lips hard together, and
have a frown on their brows; but whether flushed,
or pale, or frowning, all are doing their duty—not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>a man flinches—not a hand idle. As the battle
goes on, and the men fall, the dead are dragged
amid-ships, the wounded cry out for water, the
powder-boys flit from one gun to another with
their supplies; the broadsides of the enemy strike
the ship like the smashing of a dozen doors with
crow-bars, and the captain shouts, at the top of his
voice, down the waist from the quarter-deck, ‘Go
it, my lads! for the honour of old England!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We never heard of such a description as this
before. Why do the wounded cry out for water?
Do their wounds make them thirsty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Almost all the wounded suffer from thirst;
but whether it be from faintness or from the
fever occasioned by pain, or from both, I cannot
tell. The battle of the Nile was a very severe
fight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was Nelson who commanded the English,
was it not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. In the bay of Aboukir the French fleet
was moored in a half circle, so close to the shore
that their admiral felt certain he could only be
attacked on one side, and that the favourite manœuvre
of the English of breaking the line, was
altogether out of the question; but he little knew
the daring spirit of his opponent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what did Nelson do, then, if he could
not break the line?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By forcing a way between the shore and the
French fleet, to the surprise and consternation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>the French admiral, he was enabled to throw two
of his ships upon every one of the weathermost
of the enemy’s line, thus attacking his foe in the
very way that he most dreaded. The battle
was fearful, lasting through the night, with the
exception of a short pause at midnight—a fearful
pause.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why did they stop fighting at midnight?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was good reason for it, for the French
admiral’s ship L’Orient, a beautiful vessel of a
hundred and twenty guns, was set in flames, and
blew up with so dreadful an explosion, that, for
a season, the rage of battle was suspended, and
every one was struck with awe. The horrors of
war were then indeed seen in the fearful destruction
which had taken place. The French admiral
had perished.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a number must have been killed in that
ship!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There were only two ships out of the whole
fleet of the enemy that made their escape! And
thus was the better part of the French navy destroyed,
the coast blockaded, and Buonaparte, who
had invaded Egypt, cut off from holding communication
with France. When the Orient blew up
she had plunder on board, obtained from Malta,
amounting to more than half a million of money.
But what is money compared with human life!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What would Buonaparte do when he knew
the best part of his navy was destroyed?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“When Buonaparte heard of what had taken
place he heaved a sigh. ‘To France,’ said he,
‘the Fates have decreed the empire of the land;
to England that of the sea.’ Nelson said, that
victory was not a word strong enough for the occasion.
He sent orders through the fleet that a
general thanksgiving might be offered up to Almighty
God for the success which had attended
his Majesty’s arms.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He never forgets that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was an odd thing, that Captain Hallowell
should have had a coffin made out of the mast of
the Orient, but so it was, and he sent it to Nelson,
with the following letter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>“‘I have taken the liberty of presenting you a
coffin, made of the main-mast of L’Orient, that
when you have finished your military career in
this world, you may be buried in one of your trophies.
But that that period may be far distant
is the earnest wish of your sincere friend,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Benjamin Hallowell</span>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Nelson accepted it kindly, in the spirit in
which it was sent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a very odd present to make.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was, and the more so because sailors are
very superstitious. I knew an instance myself
wherein the better part of a ship’s crew were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>thrown into consternation by a noise which they
heard day and night; a shrill tapping against the
ship’s side. This turned out to be no more than
a suspended frying-pan tapping, with the motion
of the vessel, against an iron or a copper bolt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What brave fellows they must have been!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About the middle of the war which commenced
in 1672, a party of French officers, dressed
as fiends, with large tails, and pitchforks, presented
themselves at midnight on the glacis of Valenciennes,
then garrisoned by a Spanish corps. The
terrified guards abandoned the covert way, and
sought shelter in the town. Closely the French
pursued, and secured one of the gates before the
portcullis could be lowered. The garrison fled
at their approach, and permitted them, without
resistance, to occupy two of the bastions. Joined
by a regiment of dragoons, Vauban, who commanded
the party, took possession of what was
then deemed the strongest fortress in Flanders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the siege of Saragossa, in 1709, the Conde
del Pueblo, who commanded for King Charles,
succeeded in persuading the garrison and the citizens
that the investing army consisted only of
phantoms, raised by enchantment. For several
days the people continued under this delusion; nor
were they undeceived till a party of them, making
a sortie, contrary to the orders of the court, had
their heads cut off by the French light horse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not generally known that the capture of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Missolonghi by the Egyptians, was owing to the
superstition of the Greeks. One of their augurs,
looking through the blade-bone of a newly-killed
sheep, prognosticated that all attempts to relieve
it would be baffled. The Spezziote fleet immediately
sailed away, leaving the brave Suliots to
their fate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell us what you can of Admiral Nelson,
uncle.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Admiral Nelson, boys, was old England’s
right hand. A very thunderbolt in war, and devoted,
as much as a seaman could be, to his country’s
cause. Life is but a short cruise—the best
bower anchor may be tripped, the main-sheet rent,
and the main-mast go by the board with the best
of us, without leaving us time to write up our log.
As every man has his faults, I suppose he had his;
however, it is not my business to speak of them,
but only to tell you how fearlessly and successfully
he stood forward in defence of his country, and in
defiance of his enemies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was sadly wounded, was he not, for his
picture is always drawn with one arm?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He lost the sight of one eye at the siege of
Calvi, by a shot driving the sand and gravel into
it, and he lost his arm by a shot in an expedition
against Teneriffe; but the most dangerous of his
daring exploits were, boarding the battery at San
Bartolomeo, boarding the San Joseph, the boat
action in the bay of Cadiz, and the famous battles
of the Nile and Trafalgar. Of these, perhaps, the
boat action during the blockade of Cadiz was the
most severe. While making an attempt against
the Spanish gun-boats, he was attacked by D.
Miguel Tregayen in an armed launch, carrying
twenty-six men; fearful odds against his ten
bargemen, captain, and coxswain. Eighteen Spaniards
were killed, the rest wounded, and the
launch captured.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“The Spaniards were more than two to one,
and yet he beat them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did; but it was a hard and desperate
struggle, hand to hand and blade to blade. Twice
did John Sykes, the coxswain, save Nelson’s life,
by parrying off blows that would have destroyed
him, and once did he interpose his head to receive
the blow of a Spanish sabre; but he would willingly
have died for his admiral.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was poor Sykes killed, or was he only
wounded?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wounded badly, but not killed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s right, for he was a faithful fellow.
It would have been a sad pity if he had been
killed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When Nelson’s health was established after
the loss of his arm, he sent to the minister of St.
George’s, Hanover-square, the following desire to
offer up his thanksgiving:—‘An officer desires to
return thanks to Almighty God for his perfect
recovery from a severe wound, and also for the
many mercies bestowed on him.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was humble enough, then, to be thankful
to God.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was; and continued so in the midst of all
his successes. I will give you an instance of his
coolness in the hour of danger. The late Lieutenant-general
the Hon. Sir William Stewart, as
lieutenant-colonel of the rifle-brigade, embarked
to do duty in the fleet which was led by Sir Hyde
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Parker and Nelson, to the attack of Copenhagen
in 1801. ‘I was,’ says he, ‘with Lord Nelson when
he wrote the note to the Crown Prince of Denmark,
proposing terms of arrangement.’ A cannonball
struck off the head of the boy who was crossing
the cabin with the light to seal it. ‘Bring
another candle,’ said his lordship. I observed, that
I thought it might very well be sent as it was, for
it would not be expected that the usual forms
could be observed at such a moment. ‘That is
the very thing that I should wish to avoid, Colonel,’
replied he, ‘for if the least appearance of precipitation
were perceptible in the manner of sending
this note, it might spoil all.’ Another candle
being now brought, his lordship sealed the letter,
carefully enclosed in an envelope, with a seal
bearing his coat-of-arms and coronet, and delivered
it to the officer in waiting to receive it. It is said
that the moment was a critical one, and that Lord
Nelson’s note decided the event.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, the next ball to that which took off
the boy’s head might have killed Nelson, and yet
he seems to have felt no fear at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A brave man may feel fear, but it will not
keep him from the discharge of what he looks upon
as his duty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did Nelson do at the battle of Copenhagen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you of the battle of Copenhagen,
in few words. It was in the year 1801 that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>British fleet, under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker and
Vice-admiral Lord Nelson, sailed into the Baltic
to attack the northern Powers before they joined
their fleets to those of France and Holland. The
Danes had made great preparation. They had six
sail-of-the-line, eleven floating batteries, and small
craft without number, chained to one another, and
to the ground. These were all under the protection
of the Crown batteries, which mounted more
than four score guns, besides the fortifications of
the Island of Amack. But the British admirals
were all undaunted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing would daunt Admiral Nelson. He
was always ready, if what is said of him is true,
to fight with the enemies of his country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nelson, who might have taken for his motto,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In battle’s front the foremost place I claim,</div>
      <div class='line'>The first in danger, as the first in fame!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>led on the attack, with twelve ships of the
line, besides frigates and fire-ships. There was
plenty to do, and no hanging back on the part of
British sailors. For four hours there was as hard
fighting as any one could desire, thundering away
on both sides, crashing and smashing, till the
whole Danish fleet, with the exception of a few
schooners and bomb-vessels, were sunk, burnt, or
taken. Had not a negotiation taken place, most
likely the Danish capital would have been destroyed.
I will give you an anecdote of Admiral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Nelson and a common seaman, that few people
know of. It was told me by Hewson’s master.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who was Hewson?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen, and you shall hear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A seaman of the name of Hewson, who had
served under Lord Nelson, was working as a caster
in a manufactory at Birmingham when Nelson
visited the place. Among other manufactories, the
admiral paid a visit to that where Hewson was at
work as a brassfounder; and though no employment
disfigures a workman more with smoke and
dust than the process of casting, the quick eye
of Nelson recognized in the caster an old associate.
‘What, Hewson, my lad!’ said he, ‘are
you here?’ Hewson laid hold of the hair that hung
over his forehead, and making an awkward bow,
replied, ‘Yes, your honour.’ ‘Why, how comes
this about! You and I are old acquaintances; you
were with me in the Captain when I boarded the
San Joseph, were you not?’ Hewson again laid
hold of his hair, and bowing, replied, ‘Yes, your
honour.’ ‘I remember you well,’ said Nelson:
‘you were one of the cleverest fellows about the
vessel! If anything was to be done Hewson was
the lad to do it. Why, what do you do here, working
like a negro? Take this,’ throwing him money,
‘and wash the dust down your throat.’ Hewson
withdrew to a neighbouring ale-house, boasting of
the character the admiral had given him. Month
after month passed away, but Hewson returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>not—his shop-tools were abandoned, and no one
could account for his absence. At length a stripling,
in a sailor’s jacket, entered the manufactory
and said, ‘He was come to settle his father’s
affairs.’ This was no other than Hewson’s son,
from whose account it appeared, that when Hewson,
somewhat elevated with liquor, but more with
the praise the admiral had bestowed on him, quitted
Birmingham, he walked his way down to Portsmouth,
entered once more on board Lord Nelson’s
ship, and fell with him in the battle of Trafalgar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Hewson!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the battle of the Nile Nelson took nine
French ships of the line, and burnt two; but Trafalgar
was his grand fight. Collingwood, in the
Royal Sovereign, led the lee-line of fourteen ships.
Nelson, in the Victory, was at the head of the
weather-line, consisting of fourteen ships. Besides
these there were four frigates.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many ships were there against them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ships of France and Spain opposed to the
British were in number thirty-three, with seven
large frigates. The odds were great against the
English, but the superior tactics, and well-known
bravery of Nelson, clothed him with power, and
more than made up the difference. I speak, boys,
of Nelson as a man, well knowing that the God
of battle can alone give success to a mortal arm.
Nelson knew this well, and, when everything was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>prepared for the engagement, he retired into his
cabin alone and wrote down the following prayer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘May the great God, whom I worship, grant
to my country, and for the benefit of Europe in
general, a great and glorious victory, and may
no misconduct in any one tarnish it, and may
humanity after victory, be the predominant feature
in the British fleet! For myself, individually,
I commit my life to Him that made me; and may
his blessing alight on my endeavours for serving
my country faithfully! To him I resign myself,
and the just cause which is entrusted to me to defend.
Amen! Amen! Amen!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a solemn prayer! It seems almost as
if he thought he should be sure to be killed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He wore on the day of the battle his admiral’s
frock coat, and on his left breast, over his heart,
boys, four stars of the orders of honour, which had
been conferred upon him. Those around thought
it was dangerous to wear his stars, lest he should
be too plainly seen by the enemy, but they were
afraid to tell him so, because he had said, ‘In
honour I gained them, and in honour I will die
with them.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O dear! he should not have worn his stars.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The effect produced by the signal given by
Lord Nelson, ‘England expects every man to do
his duty!’ was wonderful; it ran from ship to ship,
from man to man, from heart to heart, like a train
of gunpowder. Officers and men seemed animated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>with one spirit, and that was a determination
to win the day, or at least never to surrender
to the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There must be something terrible in preparing
for such a fight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is, boys, but it wears off by degrees.
The captains commanded on their quarter-decks;
the boatswains in the forecastle; the gunners attended
to the magazines, and the carpenters, with
their shot-plugs, put themselves in readiness with
high-wrought energy; nor were the seamen and
marines a whit behind-hand in entering on their
several duties. The guns, the tackle, the round
grape, and canister-shot, the powder-boys, the
captains of guns, with their priming-boxes, and
the officers with their drawn swords, cut an imposing
appearance; and the cockpit would have
made a ruddy face turn pale.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was there to be seen in the cockpit?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You forget that the wounded are all taken
down into the cockpit. It will hardly bear thinking
about. But, in the cockpit were laid out ready
for use, wine, water, and surgeon’s instruments,
with napkins and basins, sponges, and bandages.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We don’t like the cockpit at all. How
does a man feel when he is in battle for the
first time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“According to his disposition, I suppose, but I
can only answer for myself. In my first battle I
felt a sense of great danger, an expectation and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>fear of being killed suddenly; a difficulty in
breathing, and a shame of playing the coward.
At Trafalgar the combined fleets of France and
Spain, under Villeneuve, the French admiral, a
brave and skilful man, were in the form of a
crescent, and the two British lines ran down upon
them parallel to each other. As soon as the British
van was within gun-shot the enemy opened
their fire. The Royal Sovereign soon rounded-to
under the stern of the Santa Anna, and Admiral
Nelson’s ship the Victory laid herself on
board the Redoubtable. From that moment the
roaring of guns, the crash against the sides of the
ships, clouds of smoke, splintered yards, and falling
masts, were the order of the day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a dreadful scene! None but soldiers
and sailors could bear it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The death-warrant of the navy of France
was signed and sealed by the fight of Trafalgar;
and afterwards Britannia was to rule the waves.
In the heat of the action a ball, fired from the
mizen-top of the Redoubtable, struck Admiral
Nelson on the left shoulder, when he instantly
fell. ‘They have done for me at last, Hardy,’
said he, to his captain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, poor Nelson! He should not have worn
those glittering stars on his breast. No wonder
that he was killed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Though mortally wounded, he gave some necessary
directions concerning the ship, and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>carried below inquired earnestly how the battle
went on. When he knew that the victory had
been gained—for twenty ships in all struck to the
British admiral—he expressed himself satisfied.
‘Now I am satisfied,’ said he; ‘thank God, I
have done my duty!’ Many times he repeated
this expression, and ‘Thank God, I have done my
duty;’ and ‘Kiss me, Hardy,’ were among the last
words that were uttered by his lips. Thus, with
a heart full of patriotism, died the bravest commander,
the most vigilant seaman, and the most
ardent friend of his country, that ever led on a
British fleet to victory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Nelson!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even amid the exultation of victory a grateful
country mourned his loss. A bountiful provision
was made for his family; a public funeral
was awarded to his remains, and monuments in
the principal cities of his native land were erected
to his memory. A sorrowing nation lamented
over his bier, and Britannia, indeed, felt that old
England’s defender was numbered with the dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who are the principal admirals of England,
those who have been famous for their victories?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There have been so many of them, that you
must be satisfied with a few. In my rambling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>way I will run over their names. There have been
British admirals stern and kind-hearted, crabbed,
and good-tempered, but all of them brave. A sailor’s
figure-head, whether he be ‘before the mast’
or admiral of the fleet, should always telegraph
good-humour to the craft around him; but some of
our admirals have been crusty old boys. You remember,
perhaps, my speaking of the hearty old
admirals in the Naval Gallery of Greenwich, in
their curled wigs, red, blue, and brown coats, loose
robes, ermine capes, armour, and buff leathern
jackets?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, uncle! yes! And you said there was
no fixed uniform in old times for the navy.”</p>

in the service of Holland. Van Tromp was
the very first of Dutch Admirals, the Nelson of
his country, having been in fifty naval engagements,
winning thirty-three victories; he was
considered the most intrepid and the ablest seaman
of his day. You will not find a Dutchman
who does not know all about Van Tromp. It
has been said, that he carried a besom at his
mast-head to sweep the seas of British ships,
but since then British admirals have turned sweepers
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed they have, and Admiral Von Tromp,
if he were alive would not be able to hinder
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I might say something of Christopher Columbus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>admiral of Spain, discoverer of the continent
of America; of Vasquez da Gama, admiral of
Portugal, discoverer of the passage to India by
the Cape of Good Hope; and of Villeneuve, the
French Admiral; but I must pass them all by
to speak a word of British admirals. And first,
let me tell you, that Thomas Smith, admiral of
the blue, was known among seamen as Tom of
Ten Thousand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a comical name! No doubt he was
a very famous man?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leaving the older admirals, Hawkins, Drake,
and Blake, let us come at once to Admiral Hawke.
He has the reputation of being not only brave but
also circumspect; to the most consummate courage
and active spirit he added a temper cool
and deliberate; accident ruffled him not; sudden
misfortune seemed not to take him by surprise.
I will give you one instance of his coolness
and steady self-possession. When his flag was
on board the Royal George, the ship once took
fire, owing to a collection of soot in the funnel
of the stove of the great cabin. A man of less
presence of mind would have given an alarm
instantly to the whole ship; but instead of this,
Sir Edward, who was at the time dressing
himself, went on deck without manifesting any
emotion, and taking aside the first-lieutenant,
said to him in a low tone, ‘Sir, the ship is on
fire in my cabin; give the necessary directions
for putting it out.’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“Capital! capital! Why, we should have cried
out fire! as loud as we could scream.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And by that means have gathered round you
those who would have only been in each other’s
way. I have given you an instance of coolness in
Admiral Hawke; I will now give you an example
of fidelity and integrity in Admiral Rodney.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! we have heard of Admiral Rodney; he
was a very brave commander.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“After many instances of bravery and skill,
he unfortunately engaged in election contests, and
became so poor that he was obliged to retire to
France to escape from the pursuit of his creditors.
When in this forlorn situation, the Duke
de Biron invited him to his house, treated him
very hospitably, and then hinted, that if he would
enter the French navy it would be greatly to
his advantage. But the blue-jacket that would
fight against his country, even to be made lord-high-admiral
of an enemy’s navy, would deserve
to be tarred and feathered. Rodney began to
think that the duke was a little deranged in
his intellects, but what was his surprise when
the duke told him, that he was commissioned by
his royal master, the king, to offer him the command
of a French squadron, with unbounded advantages,
should he accept the appointment. What
do you think was Rodney’s answer?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, if he were a true Englishman, he would
never fight against his own country.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“Right, right! This was his reply to the duke.
‘My distresses, sir, it is true, have driven me from
the bosom of my country, but no temptation whatever
can estrange me from her service. Had this
offer been a voluntary one of your own, I should
have deemed it an insult, but I am glad that it
proceeds from a source that <i>can do no wrong</i>.’ It
is a common saying, ‘A king can do no wrong.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well done, Admiral Rodney! He was a true
Englishman. No doubt the duke was in a fine
passion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite the contrary. There is that in an upright
and noble action which commands respect.
The brave respect the brave, and the faithful respect
the faithful all the world over. The duke
was so struck with admiration of the British tar’s
patriotism that he instantly became his friend.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then the duke had a noble mind too. Please
to tell us a little of Admiral Rodney’s bravery.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When captain of the Eagle, he engaged two
French vessels of equal force, but being disabled,
he was obliged to drop astern. Undaunted by his
ill success, he rove new braces, and repaired his
wheel, which had been in part shot away, and then
once more, crowding all the sail he could stretch
on his shattered spars, returned to the attack.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rodney was as courageous, then, as he was
faithful?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. His grand battle was with the French
Admiral Comte de Grasse, off Dominica. I will
tell you how he got the victory.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“Oh, he fired away till he sank the Frenchmen,
or perhaps he boarded them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, he went upon a very different plan; and
it was the very first time that plan was adopted.
He sailed boldly on, and broke the enemy’s line;
thus exposing one wing of the fleet to a double
attack. This enabled him to obtain the victory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! we remember now, that you told us
about breaking the line at the same time that
you spoke of your two school-fellows, Captain
Bentley and Captain Baines. We see that it is
not courage and power alone that conquers, but
skill and prudence, and a knowledge of naval
tactics.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This bold enterprize of breaking the line of
the enemy has, since then, often been effected,
but I believe, as I said before, that Admiral
Rodney set the example, though the thought did
not spring from his own mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rodney, it is said, owing to particular circumstances,
found it necessary to keep up proper
discipline in the navy, and control faction
by an uncompromising sternness of conduct, not
belonging to his natural character. He was compelled,
as he believed, to convince those under
his command that he was not a man to be trifled
with.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The policy pursued by Lord Nelson for securing
the obedience of his captains was the reverse
of this, but equally successful. This great commander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>cultivated the personal attachment of
those under his orders by familiar and confidential
intercourse. After settling in his own mind
the plan of a campaign, or mode of attack, he
would, it is said, communicate it to his captains;
sometimes separately, sometimes collectively, as
if to consult them on the soundness of what he
projected, putting the case to them in the interrogative
or consulting tone, as to what he had
decided upon, leaving an opening for their lights
and corrections; and it is believed that he stated
the case differently from what he had secretly decided
on, but led them to offer an opinion and
advice in accordance with his real determination,
in order to pay them the flattering compliment
of having amended his plan. ‘Your idea,’ he
would say, ‘is the better of the two.’ This illustrates
how the same end may be attained by
different, and even opposite means, according to
the difference of circumstances. Lord Nelson’s
captains had lived with him in affectionate personal
intercourse, loving and respecting him.
Lord Rodney had little or no acquaintance with
the great majority of his captains, and had reason
to believe that they neither loved nor respected
him much; but, by a demeanour suited to such
circumstances, he equally secured their obedience
and co-operation, after the first misunderstanding
and neglect of duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“During an action of Admiral Rodney with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>the French, a woman assisted at one of the guns
upon the main-deck, and being asked by the admiral
what she did there, she replied, ‘An’t
please your honour, my husband is sent down
to the cockpit wounded, and I am here to supply
his place. Do you think, your honour, I am
afraid of the French?’ After the action, Lord
Rodney called her aft, told her she had been
guilty of a breach of orders, by being on board,
and rewarded her with ten guineas for so gallantly
supplying the place of her husband.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a strange woman that must have been!
She was more like a man than a woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There have been several instances of women
becoming soldiers and sailors. At the siege of
Saragossa a young woman took her part at the
guns; and an extraordinary woman, named Mary
Schellenck, died a short time since, at Menin.
She was a native of Ghent, and in March 1792,
entered the second Belgian battalion as a male
volunteer. On the 6th of November in that year
she distinguished herself in the battle of Gemappes,
and received six wounds. She afterwards
entered the thirtieth demi-brigade (Batavian), and
made the campaigns of Germany. She was next
removed to the eighth light infantry, and displayed
great bravery at the battle of Austerlitz,
in which she received a severe wound, which led
to the discovery of her sex. She, however, continued
to follow the regiment; and at last presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>a petition with her own hand to Napoleon. The
emperor received her with marked distinction,
placed her tenth on the list of lieutenants, invested
her with his own hands with a cross of the legion
of honour, which he himself had worn. In 1807
she was granted a pension of six hundred and
seventy-three francs. Her funeral, which was
celebrated in the church of Menin, was attended
by every member of the legion of honour belonging
to the garrison, and an immense concourse of
people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was a more famous woman than the
other; but it was rather a pity that she could find
nothing to do besides fighting. What have women
to do with battles?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Vincent, Duncan and Howe, are great names
as naval commanders. One of the most brilliant
victories mentioned in English history was achieved
by Vincent. He went to sea at ten years of age.
When posted, he was appointed to the Gosport.
Afterwards he captured the Pallas, a French frigate,
and was present in Admiral Keppel’s action
with the French. Under Admiral Barrington he
chased and fought the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pégase</span>, a French seventy-four,
capturing her without the loss of a single
man. With his flag on board the Victory of one
hundred guns, he came face to face with his enemy
on the 14th of February, 1797, fighting one of
the most famous battles, and achieving one of the
most splendid victories ever recorded in the roll
of fame.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“Vincent will not soon be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Duncan’s victory over the Dutch fleet off
Camperdown was a gallant affair, and it has handed
down his name in the list of Britain’s warriors.
Assembling his crew in the presence of the captured
Dutch admiral, he kneeled down at their
head to offer up his thanksgiving to the God of
battles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a sight to see them all kneeling on the
deck!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Admiral Lord Howe, when a captain, was
once hastily awakened in the middle of the night
by the lieutenant, who informed him, with great
agitation, that the ship was on fire near the magazine.
‘If that be the case,’ said he, rising leisurely
to put on his clothes, ‘we shall soon hear
a farther report of the matter.’ The lieutenant
flew back to the scene of danger, and almost instantly
returning, exclaimed, ‘You need not, sir,
be afraid, the fire is extinguished.’ ‘Afraid,’ exclaimed
Howe; ‘what do you mean by that, sir?
I never was afraid in my life,’ and looking the lieutenant
full in the face, he added, ‘Pray, how does
a man feel, sir, when he is afraid? I need not ask
how he looks.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Admiral Howe was a much bolder man than
his lieutenant was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have heard, boys, the expression ‘The glorious
first of June!’ It arose from the grand battle
fought on that day, in the year 1794, between
Lord Howe and the French fleet. The name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Howe sounds like a triumph in the ears of a seaman.
The probity and generosity of seamen are as
much a proverb as their courage and recklessness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Captain, afterwards Admiral Sir F. Maitland,
agreed with Captain Dixon of the Apollo, that
they should share between them whatever prize-money
fell to their lot. Captain Dixon’s life was
a short one, and his widow was left in not very
affluent circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One day the widow was waited on by a gentleman,
who presented to her a bank check for
twenty-five thousand pounds. Surprised by so
strange a circumstance she hesitated, and then
refused to accept the munificent sum tendered to
her, when Captain Maitland addressed her thus:—‘The
agreement I made with my friend Dixon to
share our prize-money, was not an agreement for
life, but during the war, and therefore this money
is fairly yours.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Admiral Maitland was every inch a sailor!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sailors were never close in money matters.
Jack before the mast, while he has a shiner left,
will share it with any messmate he happens to fall
in with. Viscount Exmouth went to sea at the
age of thirteen, and rose rapidly in rank. Every
step was the reward of some new achievement.
When only twenty-five years old he drove three
privateers on shore at the Isle of Bass. He afterwards
captured the Cleopatra. He was sent to set
fire to a frigate and two corvettes which had run
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>ashore. He carried the vessels gallantly; but finding
them filled with wounded men, who could
not be removed, he abandoned his prizes rather
than destroy so many sufferers, unable, to help
themselves—an act of humanity that redounds
to his credit even more than his courageous exploits!
Bravery and humanity should always be
companions. In battle Exmouth was a lion, but
when the victory was won, he became a lamb.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was noble conduct; and the name of
Exmouth ought to be remembered with honour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have not heard all yet, boys; twice did
he leap overboard to save a drowning sailor from
the waves; and when no pilot would venture out
in the storm that blew the Dutton, East Indiaman,
on shore, full of troops, he magnanimously reached
the wreck in a boat, and made such judicious arrangements,
that the whole of the crew were
saved.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say what you will, but that action was ten
times better than a victory!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lord Exmouth was sent to bombard Algiers;
for the cruel pirates there would listen to no terms,
but continued to infest the ocean, and to keep in
cruel captivity their Christian slaves. So well did
he perform this service, setting all the slaves at
liberty, and doing away with slavery for ever, that
his grateful country made him a viscount.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was a kind-hearted man, and well deserved
to be rewarded.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“I have no time to speak of Admiral Sir Samuel
Hood, because I intend to read you his epitaph.
Here it is: it will speak better for him than I can.
It was written by the pen of Sir James Mackintosh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The battle of Navarino was a terrible one for
the Turks, for it almost annihilated their navy.
It took place to compel the Turks to give over
their exterminating war against the Greeks, and to
evacuate their country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who commanded the fleet at the battle of
Navarino?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Admiral Codrington. Oh, it was a terrible
conflict! The bay, and the town, and the Castle
of Navarino, formed a picturesque view; the Ottoman
fleet having crimson flags flying at their peaks,
with crescents and swords upon them. There
were evident signs of hurry on board the ships, as
though they hardly expected to be attacked so
soon. Indeed, it was afterwards understood, that
they intended to be very civil until night, and a
strong breeze should favour them in sending forth
their fire-ships.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Those fire-ships must be sad things?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“According to orders, no shot was to be fired
without a signal from the admiral; and the memorable
words of Nelson animated every heart: ‘No
captain can do very wrong who places his ship
alongside an enemy.’ The British, French, and
Russian ships had enough to do. The Turkish and
Egyptian fleets fought with desperation, but when
the battle was over, the flag of old England was
waving in the breeze of victory. I might speak
of many more admirals, and of hundreds of naval

<p class='c010'>“What say you, boys, shall I give you a few
anecdotes of French generals, as France has long
been considered the first nation in the world in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>a military point of view? Not that French soldiers
are superior to English soldiers, for he who would
say that, must altogether mistake the matter; but
they have had so much to do in warfare with the
countries around them, and their armies have been
so successful, that their fame has spread all over
the world. The battle of Waterloo sadly humbled
their pride, but for all that we must not undervalue
the intrepidity of a brave people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The more anecdotes you give us the better.
Tell us of all the generals that you can remember.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have spent much of my time in reading of
military characters, and could, therefore, tell you
of a great number. Many a day has passed since
I slept in the camp, and mingled in the stormy
fight, but old habits cling to us closely, and there
is hardly a day of my life but I take up a book
on naval or military subjects. I read of admirals
and sea captains, of generals and distinguished
commanders, and then I think of my earlier days,
and of the wild scenes of war. Many of my old
comrades, though living, are dead to me, for they
are scattered about the world, and many who are
really dead are alive in my remembrance. You
shall have a few anecdotes of some of the French
generals. Whatever may have been their failings,
no one can call in question their personal bravery;
and a true soldier will never cover the name of
an enemy with the slime of slander, but rather
speak the truth, be it good or evil.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“Please to begin about the French generals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“General Desaix was called by the Germans,
‘The good Desaix,’ for though he was among them
as a conqueror, he treated them with humanity.
The Arabs called him the ‘Just Sultan.’ He
feared no danger when in the field, and met the
death of a soldier bravely. At the battle of Marengo
he was fatally struck by a ball, at the first
charge of his division. ‘Tell the first consul,’ said
he, ‘that I only regret having done nothing for
posterity.’ The day before the battle, he observed
to one of his aides-de-camp, ‘It is a long while
since I fought in Europe, something will happen,
for the bullets will not know me again.’ Buonaparte,
though in the hottest of the engagement,
when he heard of his death was much affected,
and one of his earliest commands after the fight
was, that a splendid monument should be erected
on the top of Mont St. Bernard to the memory
of his fallen general.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Desaix! He was not so cruel as many
conquerors have been. Who was the very bravest
of Buonaparte’s generals?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Marshal Ney was one of the most daring of
Buonaparte’s generals, and indeed, the Emperor
called him ‘The bravest of the brave.’ When
retreating from Smolensko, under the most disastrous
circumstances, he found himself almost
on the edge of a ravine manned by Russians, with
a line of batteries on the opposite bank, before he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>was aware of his situation. It was almost a hopeless
position, and a Russian officer appeared and
summoned him to capitulate, when his answer
was, ‘A Mareschal of France never surrenders.’
Though the batteries opened on him a tremendous
fire, he fearlessly plunged into the ravine, cleared
a passage over the stream in spite of all opposition,
and attacked his enemies at their guns. None but
a soldier can estimate his danger and his daring.
Again and again he was beaten back, but all in
vain, for in the face of the whole army of his foes
he maintained his position, disdaining to surrender
or retire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Buonaparte had not had such generals he
could never have won so many victories.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is very true. The French general
Lasnes, Duke of Montebello, distinguished himself
much in fighting against the Austrians. He
headed the storming party in the attack on Ratisbonne,
crying out, ‘Soldiers, your general has not
forgotten that he was once a grenadier.’ At the
battle of Asperge a cannon shot took away both his
legs, and when the surgeons told him his wounds
were mortal, he broke out into furious imprecations,
crying out for the Emperor. When Buonaparte
came to him, it was only to hear him blaspheme
heaven and earth, because he could not
live to see the end of the campaign. He was
called the Roland of the camp, on account of his
enthusiastic valour.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>“He might be brave, but he must have been
a very bad man to blaspheme in that manner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right. The bravery of a soldier will
never excuse his blasphemies. Soult was a very
brave and able soldier; he is held in high estimation
in France at the present time by King Louis
Philippe. Suchet, Augereau, Berthier, Rapp,
Macdonald, and Beauharnois, were all generals of
high reputation, as well as Maret, Jourdan, Grouchey,
and Vandamme. Generals Bertrand and
Gourgaud accompanied Buonaparte when he was
exiled to St. Helena.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, they did right in not forsaking him in
his misfortunes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Junot was one of the generals in the French
army under Buonaparte. During the siege of
Toulon, Junot was only a sergeant. Buonaparte,
while constructing a battery under the enemy’s
fire, had occasion to prepare a dispatch, and called
aloud for some one who could use his pen. Junot
leaped forward; but while he was leaning on the
breastwork, writing down what Buonaparte dictated,
a shot struck the ground and scattered the
dust all over him. ‘Good!’ said Junot, laughing,
‘this time we shall spare our sand?’ Buonaparte
was so much pleased by the cool intrepidity
and gaiety of the sergeant that he kept
his eye on him afterwards. In course of time
Junot became Marshal of France and Duke of
Abrantes.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“A bold man was sure to be taken notice of by
Buonaparte.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Massena and Davoust were able generals, but
very, very cruel: it would be hard to say which
were the greater, the atrocities practised by Junot
and Massena in Portugal, or those perpetrated by
Davoust on the banks of the Elbe. Courage is
a noble quality, but it will never atone for cold-hearted
cruelty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If they had come over to England they would
have served us in just the same manner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The celebrated Moreau, who fought on the
side of the Russians against his countrymen the
French, was wounded amid a group of reconnoitring
officers. Buonaparte seeing these officers
together, ordered half-a-dozen cannons to be fired
at them, when a commotion took place as though
one had been wounded. In the evening a peasant
brought a greyhound and a bloody boot to the
camp; on the collar of the greyhound was graven
the name of Moreau. They belonged, he said, to
a great man, who had fallen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! no doubt it was Moreau!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes it was. A shot had taken away both his
legs; yet such was his firmness that he smoked a
cigar while undergoing amputation, in the presence
of the Emperor Alexander. He died shortly after.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What dreadful things soldiers go through, and
yet they hardly seem to care for them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When General Lefebre besieged Saragossa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the place was defended by Don Jose Palafox, a
young nobleman of moderate talents. But men and
women fought side by side among the Spaniards,
and became irresistible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How they must have hated the French, for the
women to fight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They must indeed! The old Moorish walls
and monastic buildings in the suburbs of the
place, were manned with determined men. Disease
came and famine came among them, but for
all this, when the French general, who had taken
the convent St. Engracia, sent to Palafox this
short summons, ‘Head-quarters, Santa Engracia—capitulation,’
he received this short answer:
‘Head-quarters, Saragossa—war to the knife.’
The French were compelled to retreat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The boasting of the French general did no
good, after all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Marmont, Mortier, Dupont, Victor, and Oudinot,
were all famous generals, as well as Bernadotte
and Murat. Victor, having failed to dislodge
the enemy at Montereau, fell under the displeasure
of Buonaparte, who broke out into a furious
passion, and dismissed him the service. Victor
then declared, while the tears streamed down his
face, that though he had ceased to be an officer
he would still be a soldier, and that, as he had
risen from the ranks, he would again enter them
as a private soldier. This melted Buonaparte, who
gave him his hand, and told him that, though he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>could not give him the command of his corps, for
it had been assigned to another, he was welcome
to place himself at the head of a brigade of the
guard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, he did not serve as a common soldier?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. His determination to do so rather than
to quit the army, softened the heart of Buonaparte,
and made him relent. It is related, that on
one occasion, when a desperate attack was led on
by Soult, there occurred a circumstance, as honourable
as it was characteristic of the spirit
which animated the French. The soldiers of two
regiments, or demi-brigades of the army of Italy,
namely, the twenty-fifth, light, and the twenty-fourth
of the line, had sworn eternal enmity
against one another, because that previously to
the opening of the campaign, when desertion,
and all the evils of insubordination prevailed in
that army, disorganized by suffering, the former,
in which discipline had been maintained, was employed
to disarm the latter. The utmost care had
been taken to keep them separate; but it happened
that these two corps found themselves one day
made rivals, as it were, in valour, the one before
the eyes of the other. The same dangers, the same
thirst of glory, the same eagerness to maintain
themselves, at once renewed in all hearts generous
sentiments; the soldiers became instantly intermingled;
they embraced in the midst of the fire,
and one half of the one corps passing into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>ranks of the other, they renewed the combat
after the exchange, with double ardour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a very odd thing! It shows that soldiers
can forgive one another, however!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The battle of Marengo, fought between the
French and the Austrians, shows us, that without
good tactics a field may be lost almost in the moment
of victory. The Austrians, under Melas,
were full forty thousand strong, while the French,
under Buonaparte, in the absence of their reserve,
could hardly be more than half that number.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two to one—that was a terrible difference.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The French advance-troops were under Gardanne.
Victor led on the first line; Lannes the
second; and Napoleon Buonaparte the third. The
Austrian heavy infantry were formed into two
lines; the first was commanded by General Haddick,
the second by Melas, who had also General
Zach with him, while General Elsnitz commanded
the light infantry and cavalry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a trampling and clashing there must be
when one army meets another in battle!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On came the Austrians, and back fell Gardanne,
to strengthen Victor. A furious cannonading
took place along the whole front of that
position, on the edge of a ravine, the muskets
of either party almost touching each other. Marengo
was taken and retaken several times. The
French, at last, were beaten back, for General
Elsnitz, with his splendid cavalry, had outflanked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>them on the right, and the retreating columns of
Lannes had to sustain the squadrons that were
poured upon him. The retreat became general.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did Buonaparte think of it then? He
could not much like to fly before the Austrians.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just as the Austrian cavalry were rushing
on, Desaix, the French general, with the reserve,
appeared on the field. ‘I think this is a lost battle,’
said he to Buonaparte. ‘And I think it is a
battle won,’ replied Napoleon. ‘Push on, and I
will rally behind you.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Buonaparte never gives up while there is any
hope of obtaining a victory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, had General Melas pursued his advantage
there can be little doubt that he would have
obtained a complete victory. He drew back, however,
to the rear, making sure of the battle, and
left General Zach to pursue the fugitives. This was
an error, for which he dearly paid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why did he not go on, when he was conquering?
That was the worst time in the world to
fall back to the rear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The old general was then eighty-four years
old, and therefore we can hardly wonder at it.
Desaix led on his troops, and fell dead at the
first fire, but General Kellerman, with the French
cavalry, made such a desperate charge that the
Austrians could not sustain it. Post after post
was taken by the French, and the Austrians by
whole troops surrendered, being unable to cross
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>the river. Kellerman and Desaix, no doubt, won
the victory, but the battle was lost by the error
committed by General Melas, and by the rashness
with which the Austrians advanced in all the
confidence of success. The way to go through
life, boys, is neither to be too much cast down
by adversity nor too much elated with prosperity.
When Mr. Pitt, the British minister, read the
bulletin of Marengo, he had so little hope of
withstanding the French, on the continent, that
he said, ‘Fold up that map,’ the map of Europe,
‘it will not be wanted for these twenty years.’
Buonaparte prided himself much on the battle of
Marengo, it is one of the victories commemorated
on the Napoleon Pillar in Paris.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please to tell us of the Napoleon Pillar?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This Pillar stands in the Place Vendome. It
is a hundred and thirty feet high, and entirely
covered with brass, furnished by the pieces of
cannon taken in many victories from the Austrians.
It is one of the most beautiful works of
art, of the kind, to be seen anywhere. The different
victories gained by Buonaparte are represented
in spiral compartments, after the manner
of the famous Trajan’s Pillar, at Rome. The
figure of Buonaparte some years ago was placed
at the top of the Napoleon Pillar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is one battle in which Buonaparte
fought that will never be represented on the
Napoleon Pillar.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>“And what battle is that, boys?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Waterloo! If that was put at the
top or bottom of all the rest, it would take away
a great deal of the glory of Napoleon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is but little danger of Waterloo being
added to the battles on the pillar in the Place
Vendome; but let us not give our minds to boasting.
The French are a brave nation, though they
have too frequently forgotten, in their successes,
that mercy and magnanimity which ought to be
extended to the conquered. Some people say ‘the
French <i>will</i> win, the English <i>cannot</i> lose,’—meaning
thereby that the French are intrepid in their
attacks, but that the cool courage and persevering
fortitude of the English are not to be overcome.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Heroism is the union of high motives and high
actions; when, therefore, I describe instances of
bravery, they may, or they may not, be examples
of heroism. Certain it is, that common sailors,
and men in the ranks, among soldiers, have manifested
as much courage as the most distinguished
officers. A life-guardsman, usually called
the Marquess of Granby, on account of his being
bald, had his horse shot under him, and lost his
helmet. The moment he arose from the ground,
though on foot, he attacked a cuirassier, whom he
killed, mounted his horse, and rode forward, while
his companions cheered him with the cry, ‘Well
done, Marquess of Granby!’ Shaw, also a corporal,
at the battle of Waterloo, was attacked by
six of the French imperial-guard; four of these he
killed, though he was afterwards slain by the remaining
two. But I have another instance of courage,
still more extraordinary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please to relate it to us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the battle of Dettingen, on the 16th of
June 1743, a private in Bland’s dragoons, of the
name of Thomas Brown, who had not been more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>than a year in the service, singularly distinguished
himself by his intrepidity. After having had two
horses killed under him, and lost two fingers of his
left hand, seeing the regimental standard borne off
by some of the enemy, in consequence of a wound
received by the cornet, he galloped into the midst
of the enemy, shot the soldier who was carrying
off the standard, and, having seized it, and thrust
it between his thigh and the saddle, gallantly
fought his way back through the hostile ranks;
and though covered with wounds, bore the prize
in triumph to his comrades, who greeted him with
three cheers. In this valiant exploit Brown received
eight wounds in his face, head, and neck; three
balls went through his hat, and two lodged in his
back, whence they could never be extracted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There never could be a more determined man
than Brown.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not always in the heat of action that presence
of mind, and true courage is most conspicuous.
In cases of sudden alarm and emergency a man
is tried to the utmost. It is said that the Duke
of Guise, having a mind to try the courage of Lewis
de Crillon, or Grillon, a gentleman of Avignon,
agreed with some gentlemen to give a sudden
alarm before Crillon’s quarters, as if the enemy
had been masters of the town; at the same time
he ordered two horses to the door; and rushing
into Crillon’s room, cried out that all was lost; that
the enemy were masters of the port and town, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>had put to flight all that opposed them; that two
horses were at the door, and that he must haste
and fly. Crillon was asleep when the alarm was
given, and hardly awake whilst the Duke of Guise
was speaking. However, without being at all disconcerted
by so hot an alarm, he called for his
clothes and his arms, saying, They ought not, on
too slight grounds, to give credit to all that was
said of the enemy; and even if the account was
correct, it was more becoming men of honour to
die with their arms in their hands than to survive
with the loss of the place. The Duke of Guise,
being unable to prevail on him to change his resolution,
followed him out of the room; but when
they were got half-way down stairs, not being
able to contain himself any longer, he burst out
a laughing, by which Crillon discovered the trick
that had been played him. He assumed a look
much sterner than when he only thought of going
to fight, and squeezing the Duke of Guise’s hand,
said, swearing at the same time, ‘Young man,
never make it a jest to try the courage of a man
of honour, for hadst thou made me betray any
weakness, I would have plunged my dagger in thy
heart,’ and then left him, without saying a word
more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was a dangerous joke.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No soldiers in the world have surpassed British
officers in coolness, determination, and daring
intrepidity.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“When General Wolfe received his death-wound
on the heights of Quebec, his principal care
was that he should not be seen to fall. ‘Support
me,’ said he to such as were near him; ‘let not
my brave soldiers see me drop; the day is ours!
Oh! keep it!’ And with these words he expired.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Wolfe! He did not live, then, to enjoy
the victory he had obtained.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. Too often the conqueror falls in the same
hour with those he has overcome. It was so with
Sir Ralph Abercrombie, who received his death-wound
in the moment of achieving a great victory
at Alexandria, in Egypt. You have heard the
name of Colonel Gardiner, no doubt. I will tell
you of his latter end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a number of brave men must have
fallen on the field of battle! Now for Colonel
Gardiner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The day before the battle of Preston Pans
he rode through the ranks of his regiment, and
addressed his men in the most respectful and animating
manner. Perceiving a timidity in part of
his troops, he determined to set them a spirited
example. ‘I cannot,’ said he, ‘influence the conduct
of others as I could wish, but I have one life
to sacrifice to my country’s safety, and I shall not
spare it.’ They continued under arms all night,
and in the morning, by break of day, perceived
the approach of the rebel army, under Prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Charles. The highlanders, though half-armed,
charged with such impetuosity, that in less than
ten minutes after the battle began the King’s
troops were broken and totally routed. After
Colonel Gardiner’s own regiment of dragoons had
forsaken him, perceiving a party of the foot continuing
to oppose the enemy, without an officer,
he immediately headed them, though already twice
wounded, exclaiming, ‘Fight on, my lads, and
fear nothing.’ At the instant he was cut down
by the scythe of a highlander, fastened to a long
pole, and fell, covered with wounds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When the engagement was over Colonel Gardiner
was pointed out to Charles, among those
who had fallen in the field. The Pretender stooping
over him, gently raised his head from the
ground, and exclaimed, “Poor Gardiner, would to
God I could restore thy life!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is a sad account, however. Please to
tell us about Major André; we have been told
that he was hung as a spy, many years ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was; and this happened in America. It
was a dangerous service that he entered on, and
it cost him his life. Major André has the credit
of having been an able officer, and an amiable
man. In the American war Arnold, a general
officer, offered to turn traitor to his party, and
give up the strong fortress of West-Point to the
English. Major André landed to arrange the affair
with him, but the Vulture Sloop, in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>intended to return, was removed further along the
Hudson River, being threatened by a battery, so
the Major was compelled to venture by land to
New York. He had a passport from Arnold,
and set off on horseback, but when he had almost
reached the English lines an American militiaman,
who was patroling between the two armies,
rushed from a thicket and seized his horse by the
bridle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor fellow! Then there was no hope for
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had the Major presented his passport, he
might, perhaps, have been permitted to pass unquestioned;
but, instead of that, he asked the
patrol to which party he belonged. The man replied,
‘<i>To the party down below.</i>’ The Major, mistaking
him for an Englishman, said, ‘<i>And I also.</i>’
This was a sad error, for two other patrols came
up, and he was taken. In vain he offered them
his watch and purse to let him escape, but they
would not. He was tried by a court-martial, and
sentenced to die.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a sad thing that he did not show them
his passport.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was; but we must look at the thing fairly.
Had an American officer acted the same part towards
the English, we should hardly have liked
him to escape. The Major was a noble-minded
man, for though taken himself, he did all in his
power to save the life of the traitor, Arnold. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>moment he knew that Arnold was safe he acknowledged
himself to be a British officer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! he was a courageous officer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When in prison he never complained; though
he spoke tenderly of his mother and sisters, and
recommended them to the kindness of Sir Henry
Clinton, the British general. He had requested to
be shot, that death being in accordance with military
habits, but this was not granted. When at
the place of execution he bandaged his eyes with a
white pocket-handkerchief himself, and with his
own hands placed the fatal cord round his neck.
‘I beg you not to forget,’ said he, ‘that I submit
myself to my fate like a man of courage.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are very terrible things in war. We
wish Major André had not been hung.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Almost everybody has heard of the bravery of
Sir Thomas Picton, who used to call the troops
under his command, his ‘fighting rascals.’ General
Picton, uncle to Sir Thomas, was Captain of
the 12th grenadiers at the battle of Minden, in
America, and when Sir Henry Clinton left the regiment
for the 7th dragoons, in 1779, Picton was
appointed in his place, by the express command
of His Majesty George III. On the first levee
held afterwards, the general attended to return
thanks and kiss hands on the occasion, when the
King said to him, ‘It is Captain Picton, of the
12th grenadiers, at the battle of Minden, that you
have to thank for your regiment.’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>“Oh! oh! It was for his own bravery, then,
that he was promoted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Among the names of intrepid British officers,
that of General Sir John Moore must not be
passed by. He is remembered by many with a
melancholy interest. When he was a colonel he
commanded the party that stormed and took Fort
Mozello, in the Isle of Corsica.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Corsica! That is the very place where Buonaparte
was born!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is. Well, daybreak was the time fixed upon
for the attack, and as no alarm might be given to
the garrison, the soldiers were ordered not to load:
the place was, in short, to be taken at the point of
the bayonet. Colonel Moore, with his intrepid
companions, had not proceeded more than half-way
when the enemy discovered their danger,
and discharged a volley of grape-shot. On pressed
the colonel at the head of his men, passing by the
wounded, dying, and dead, and was entering the
walls, when a bombshell bursting, struck him to
the ground. Bleeding as he was profusely, he recovered
himself, pressed on, and, in spite of the
most obstinate resistance, compelled the enemy to
surrender. Nothing but consummate skill and determined
bravery could have successfully stormed
such a fortress, well-provided as it was with stores,
garrisoned by some of the best troops of France,
and commanded by an able general. When General
Stewart, who had dismounted from his horse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>to mount the breach, found the place in possession
of the troops, he flung himself into the arms of
Colonel Moore, the soldiers shouting at the time,
and throwing up their hats for joy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a wonder that bombshell did not kill
him! But he was made a general, you say, after
that. He lived to be made a general?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did; but he died of the wounds he received
afterwards, in Spain. You may have heard the
following lines, written to his memory, but they
will bear repeating, for they are very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are beautiful lines indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lord Paget, now Marquess of Anglesey, must
ever rank as one of the most intrepid of British officers.
One or two instances of his bravery I must
give you; but I might go on for an hour to describe
the various actions, in which from time to time he
distinguished himself. He seems to have thought
nothing of danger, for he entered on the most daring
enterprizes with confidence of success.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now then, for the bravery of Lord Paget!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the narrative of Sir John Moore’s campaign
is given the following account of a charge made
on the French imperial guards, who were thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>to be almost invincible, by Lord Paget and the
10th hussars. At nine o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> five hundred
or six hundred of the imperial guard plunged
into the river and crossed over; they were immediately
opposed by the pickets under Colonel
Otway, which, when united, amounted only to
two hundred and twenty men. They retired slowly
before the enemy, bravely disputing every inch of
ground; and upon the pickets being reinforced by
a small body of the 3rd dragoons, they charged
with so much fury that the first squadron broke
through, and was for a time surrounded by the
enemy; wheeling up, they extricated themselves
by charging back through the enemy. Lord Paget
soon reached the field with the 10th hussars; and
having drawn the French from the river, he charged
the whole body; but before the British could close
the chasseurs wheeled about, and fled to the ford,
leaving on the field fifty-five killed and wounded,
and seventy prisoners; among whom was General
Lefebre. The imperial guards showed themselves
much superior to any cavalry which the British
had before engaged; they fought gallantly, and
killed or wounded near fifty of our dragoons. It
has been said, that, next to the Duke of Wellington,
no man contributed more to the success of the
battle of Waterloo than the Marquess of Anglesey,
who has been styled the ‘first cavalry officer in the
world.’ By his gallantry and dash, he excited the
admiration and kindled the spirit of his troops!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Twice had the marquess, then Earl of Uxbridge,
led the guards to the charge, cheering them with
the cry of, ‘Now for the honour of the household
troops,’ when three heavy masses of the enemy’s
infantry advanced, supported by artillery and a
numerous body of cuirassiers. The Belgians fled;
the Highland brigade received the shock. The
moment was critical; the Earl of Uxbridge galloped
up to the second brigade, which received
him with a cheer. The three regiments presented
a front of about thirteen hundred men; he placed
himself at their head, and made one of the most
rapid and destructive charges ever witnessed. The
division they attacked consisted of more than nine
thousand men; only about a thousand of these
escaped, under cover of the cuirassiers; for of the
remainder three thousand were made prisoners, and
five thousand slain. One of the last shots that
were fired struck him on the knee, and thereby
occasioned the loss of his leg.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The first cavalry officer in the world! That
is saying a great deal indeed for him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir John Elley led on the life-guards, the
Blues, and the Scotch-greys, with tremendous effect.
When surrounded by cuirassiers, he cut his way
through them, leaving many of his assailants on
the ground.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would be a hard matter to decide which
was the bravest among so many brave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should have told you before of Colonel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>Colborne, afterwards Sir John Colborne, commander-in-chief
in Canada. When he commanded
the second brigade of rifles at the storming the
heights of Beira in Portugal in 1813, he charged
the enemy, who fled to the mountains. It was an
odd circumstance, but so it occurred, that pushing
on round a hill, with only his brigade-major and
a few riflemen—for he had shot ahead of the rest
of the troops—to his great surprise, he found that
he had got before three hundred retreating Frenchmen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Colonel Colborne! Then, he was taken
prisoner by the enemy he had beaten?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not exactly so. Many a brave man would in
such a case have surrendered, and without dishonour
too, but the colonel was too gallant an
officer to think for a moment of such a course—whispering
to his brigade-major to get as many
men together as he could directly, he boldly rode
up to the French commander and demanded his
sword. The commander, not doubting but he was
outnumbered, surrendered; and thus some half-dozen
gallant Englishmen captured three hundred
Frenchmen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! that was as brave an action as we
have heard of yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I might go on to speak of Colonel Ponsonby,
General Baird, Sir Thomas Picton, Sir James
Macdonnel, Lord Edward Somerset, Sir Henry
Hardinge, Sir Colin Campbell, Colonel (general in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Spain) Evans, and fifty others; but the longest
story must have an end. Let me, therefore, hasten
on to speak a word or two on the military exploits of
the present commander-in-chief of the British army,
who can scarcely be second to any in the extent
and success of his military services. The manner
in which, as a general of division, he received and
repulsed the enemy at Talavera stamped his reputation
as a soldier. His surprise of Girard at
Arrayo de Molinas was a splendid affair. General
Brune, and the Duke d’Aremberg, a colonel of
chasseurs, and chief of the staff, with fifteen hundred
prisoners, fell into the hands of the British. The
destruction of the bridge of boats at Almanez, by
which Marshal Marmont had secured the passage
of the Tagus, was equally remarkable for judgment
in the plan, and promptitude and bravery in its
execution; while his repulse of Marshal Soult, who
fell upon him with double the number of his troops,
upon the Nive, in the battle of the 13th of December
1813, was the crowning enterprise of his
military service. ‘Hill, the day’s your own,’ said
the Duke of Wellington frankly and generously,
when he came up after the battle. Coolness,
promptitude, courage, good tactics, and success have
marked the brilliant career of Lord Hill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“General Lord Hill has not been made commander-in-chief
for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! He has seen as much service as most
men. I will read you, from the ‘United Service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Journal,’ a most extraordinary anecdote, and one
that will much interest you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In that brilliant scene of the great Peninsular
drama, enacted on the hills of the Arrepiles, now
nineteen years ago, I performed the humble part
of assistant-surgeon in the —— regiment of foot.
Like all military men, I was anxious for promotion,
and had been long trying, through every interest
I could move, to obtain a staff-surgeoncy
in the Portuguese army,—an appointment then
open to officers of my rank. My exertions, however,
had proved fruitless, and I had almost given
up the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was near sunset. The opposing armies were
in fierce collision; and as detached masses from
either side rushed forward to occupy the various
vantage-grounds of the position, the two lines
seemed to mingle, yet for a moment, to repel each
other, like meeting torrents. A long and twisted
stream of grey curling smoke marked the indentations
of the combat, whilst the sharp continuous
tearing of the musketry, and the deep interrupted
roar of the cannon, formed an awful concert.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The surgeon of my regiment and myself had
held a little council-of-war in the rear of our division,
then moving into the fight; and it was settled,
by mutual consent, that he should remain where
he then was, with the main body, and reserve of
our Æsculapian stores, to receive the more serious
cases from the front, whilst I was to keep close in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>with the regiment, to afford the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premiers secours</span></i>
to our wounded comrades before they passed
to the rear. I happened to be tolerably well
mounted. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En croupe</span></i>, I carried a pair of capacious
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">alforges</span></i>, or Spanish saddle-bags, containing, on
one side a plentiful supply of the minor apparatus
of surgery, and on the other such ‘provent’ as
Captain Dougald Dalgetty would have laid in for
a like occasion. Suspended to my saddle-bow
was a <i>borachio</i>, or leathern bag, of country
wine. Thus accoutred, I rode on with my regiment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We had just turned a rising ground, and had
come into near view of the lesser Arrepiles,
which was still crowned by a strong body of
French infantry. A Portuguese brigade was in
the act of storming the hill as we came up, and
were gallantly mounting its side; but that most
commanding point of the adverse position was
quite as gallantly defended by the enemy, who
as yet maintained their ground on its crest. A
division of the Portuguese army, led on by Sir
William Carr Beresford in person, was closely
engaged at its base, nobly rivalling the feats in
arms of their British allies.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As we pressed on towards this interesting
scene, a mounted officer, in Portuguese staff-uniform,
galloped towards us from the front, shouting
at the top of his voice, ‘A surgeon! a surgeon!
a British surgeon!’ In an instant I was at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>side, and recognised him to be Colonel Warre,
one of the marshal’s aides-de-camp. ‘Follow me,’
were the only words pronounced by him, as he
wheeled round his charger, and again spurred him
towards the line of fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After a few minutes’ gallop we drew up at
a covered waggon, to which the colonel pointed
with eagerness as he dismounted. I had already
drawn the curtains of the vehicle aside, and perceived
that it contained two persons; one in the
uniform of a sergeant, the other I immediately
recognised as the marshal himself. He was lying
on his back, dressed in a blue frock-coat and white
waistcoat. Just below the left breast was a star
of blood, bright and defined as a star of knighthood.
It was about the size of that chivalrous
decoration, and occupied the exact spot where it
is usually fixed. There was a small rent in its
centre, black and round. The eyes were half
closed; the countenance in perfect repose, perhaps
a little paler than when I had last seen it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The situation of the wound, just over the
fountain of life; the stillness of the wounded
general; the appearance of his companion, whose
lower limbs were literally mashed; the commander-in-chief
and the non-commissioned officer
laid side by side, silent, motionless, and bloody—all
struck me at the moment as a prelude to the
equality of the grave. I asked no questions, for
I had come to the conclusion that there might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>be no tongue to move in answer. In an instant
the marshal’s dress was torn open, and my forefinger,
that best of probes, was deep in his side.
Not a muscle moved, not a sound was uttered.
I felt the rib, smooth and resisting below, whilst
the track of the bullet led downwards and backwards,
round the convexity of his ample chest.
I now spoke for the first time since I had entered
the waggon, and said, ‘General, your wound is
not mortal.’ This observation of mine, which I
made quite sure could not fail to be particularly
interesting to my patient, seemed to have been
heard with perfect indifference, for without taking
the slightest notice of the very agreeable intelligence
I had just communicated, he looked up and
asked, ‘How does the day go?’ ‘Well,’ said I:
‘the enemy has begun to give way.’ ‘Hah!’ rejoined
the marshal, ‘it has been a bloody day!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“During this brief conversation I had traced
the course of the ball by a reddish wheal, which
marked its <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trajet</span></i>, and I felt the missile itself deeply
lodged in the flesh of the left loin. The preliminaries
for cutting out were arranged in a moment,
and the marshal had turned on his right side,
when the wounded sergeant, having by this time,
as I suppose, discovered my trade, began most
lustily to call upon ‘<i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Nossa senhora</span></i>,’ and the doctor,
in the same breath. I requested of him, in his
own language, to be silent, telling him at the
same time, that his general was lying wounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>by his side. Upon this the marshal turned round
his head, and with a reproving look said to me,
‘Sir, if that poor fellow’s wounds require dressing
more than mine, dress him first.’ Both the words
and the manner in which they were spoken made
a strong impression on me at the time,—and impressions
stamped on the field of battle are not
easily erased. I assured his Excellency that nothing
but amputation could be of any service to
the sergeant, and that I had not the necessary
instruments by me for such an operation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All parties were again silent, and I proceeded
to cut out the bullet. My knife was already buried
in the flesh, its point grating against the lead,
when the marshal, feeling that I had ceased to cut,
and calculating, perhaps that my steadiness as an
operator might be influenced by the rank of my
patient, again turned round, and with as much
<i>sangfroid</i> as if he had been merely a spectator,
said, in an encouraging tone, ‘Cut boldly, doctor;
I never fainted in my life.’ Almost at the same
instant I placed the bullet in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the wounds had been bound up, the
patient demanded what steps he should next
adopt. To this I replied, that it would be prudent
to have himself bled after some hours. ‘But
who is to bleed me?’ quickly rejoined the marshal.
I was in some measure prepared for this
question, and had already determined on the course
I should follow.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>“From the moment I had recognised the commander-in-chief
of the Portuguese army lying
wounded in a waggon, close in with the enemy,
and had ascertained that his wound was not necessarily
mortal, I saw that my being on the spot
at such a moment might lead to my promotion.
A fair, unimpeachable opportunity of tendering
fresh services to him on whom the accomplishment
of my ambition seemed to depend, was now
afforded me. But such is the influence of an unflinching,
unaffected firmness of character in a
chief over those below him, and such the impression
left on my mind by what I had just witnessed,
that I felt convinced I should establish a
higher place in the marshal’s good opinion by
remaining in the fight than by volunteering to
leave it, even for the purpose of attending to his
wound. I therefore respectfully submitted to his
Excellency, that my regiment was then probably
in action; that I should be sorry to be out of the
way when my friends and comrades might need
my assistance, and that I hoped he would be kind
enough to permit me to join them. ‘Most certainly,’
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I saw no more of the marshal for many weeks;
and when I had the honour of being again presented,
I found him very ill, suffering much from
inflammation in his side, and a profuse discharge
from his wounds, kept up, as was afterwards discovered,
by some portions of woollen cloth, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>the bullet had carried forward from the breast of
his coat through the loose folds of which the missile
had passed before it entered the flesh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In quitting the marshal on the field, under
the circumstances, and with impressions I have just
described, I followed the course most consonant
to my feelings, my sense of duty, and even my
views of my own interest at the time. Whether
I judged rightly upon the latter point or not,
certain it is, that when I appeared in the next
great battle-scene at Vittoria, the following year,
I had already, for some months, filled the station
of staff-surgeon in the Portuguese army.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A word or two now, boys, on the battle of
Waterloo, for that must not be forgotten. Many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>a comrade who fought with me in that battle,
without a wound, has since been brought down
by sickness to the grave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neither soldiers nor sailors can hold out long
when death attacks them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When it comes to that the <i>boldest</i> tar must
<i>strike his colours</i>, and the <i>bravest</i> soldier that ever
mounted a breach <i>surrender at discretion</i>. <i>Lancers</i>
themselves are not <i>sharp</i> enough to resist their last
enemy, nor can <i>life-guardsmen parry</i> the stroke of
<i>death</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sometimes soldiers are shot. Please to tell us
how they shoot them; it must be a sad sight!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sad indeed! so sad, that I hope and trust you
will never witness it. In a soldier, whose eye
should be bright with honour, and whose heart
should despise a deed of meanness, for him to be
paraded before his companions as an object of disgrace,
and then, perhaps, shot by those who have
fought and bled with him, and messed at the same
table! It will hardly bear to be thought of; and
the faster I hurry over the account of it the better.
The culprit is tried, and fairly tried too, by a
general court-martial, sworn to ‘do justice.’ No
sentence of death can be given against him unless
nine officers present agree therein. If condemned
to die, he is taken to the ground, where the men
are drawn up in a square, and marched round it.
He then kneels on his coffin—his eyes are bandaged,
and the few men whose melancholy duty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>it is to fire at him, aim at his heart. Every thought
of a soldier should be, honour bright by day and
night. How sad to become a spectacle of shame
and disgrace among his old companions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are sailors ever sentenced to be shot?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. Culprits at sea are run up to the yard-arm.
A naval execution is a solemn sight. On
the fatal morn, there is an influence felt by the
seamen, and if little is said about what is going
on, you may read it in their faces. The crews of
the different ships in harbour are turned up, and in
the rigging and along the gangways, groups and
lines of blue-jackets, may be seen. The boats of
the fleet are manned, and, with a party of marines
in each, are drawn up abreast the ship where the
execution is about to take place. All this occurs
early in the morning. At last comes the unhappy
culprit. He mounts the platform, that stretches
across the forecastle; a dead silence prevails; the
sentence that has been recorded against the prisoner
by the court-martial is read, as well as the
articles of war under which he has been condemned;
the signal-gun gives the fatal flash, and the unhappy
man is run up to the fore-yard-arm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be very solemn! But we hardly ever
hear of a sailor being condemned to death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not often. It is terrible to think of a blue-jacket,
who ought to be famed for honour and
honesty, dangling like a hanged dog at the yard-arm
of a seventy-four.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>“Terrible indeed. Please to tell us of a soldier’s
burial.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Those who have seen the funeral of a soldier,
especially that of a cavalry officer, know it to be
a solemn gathering; but I will not dwell upon it.
The death-like sound of the muffled drum is withering
to the heart; the mournful melody of wind-instruments,
the slow and measured steps of the procession,
the coffin where the dead man lies, the
subdued appearance of the charger, mournfully accoutred,
oppress the spirit, and the helmet and the
sword, and gauntlets, tug at the spectators’ heartstrings.
He must have a strong bosom who can
hear the blast of the crape-bound trumpet, the roll
of the muffled drum, and the three-fold volley over
the soldier’s grave, without a sigh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be very solemn, but not so sad as
shooting a soldier, or hanging a sailor at the yard-arm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The thought of <i>death</i> should lead a soldier to
act humbly in his <i>life</i>. The <i>tallest</i> grenadier ought
not to lift his head proudly above the <i>lowest</i> man in
the regiment. But I have not yet told you anything
of a sailor’s burial. When a seaman dies
he is sewn up in his hammock, with a couple of
shot fastened between his feet. As he lies upon
a grating, with his comrades around him, the
chaplain of the ship, or the captain, reads the
Burial Service appointed for the dead at sea. He
is then turned off the grating and is soon on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>way to the bottom of the deep, sinking feet-foremost
through the cold blue waters. But we
are forgetting the battle of Waterloo, and my time
is almost up; if I do not tell you about it now I
may not have another opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Begin directly! It will never do to pass it
over, such a famous battle as it was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My account must be a very short one. I can
fancy myself now on the spot. There is the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span> of Hougomont! there the farm-house
La Haye Sainte, and yonder are the heights of
La Belle Alliance! Under any circumstances a
battle on an extended scale is an affair of absorbing
interest, but when, as it were, the welfare of
the civilized world trembles in the balance; when
the sword is about to decide whether nations are
to be liberated or fettered with adamantine chains;
whether millions are to breathe the breath of freedom,
or bow their necks beneath the iron yoke
of an ambitious despot, well may a fervent prayer
be offered up to the God of battles, that right
may triumph, and that rapine and wrong may be
humbled in the dust. The battle of Waterloo was
to wrench from Napoleon Buonaparte the sword
of his might, or to place an iron sceptre in his
hand wherewith to bruise the nations of the world
at his pleasure. It pleased the God of armies that
the proud should be effectually overthrown.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay! Buonaparte was humbled in that battle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before the battle France was strong, but after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>it she was weak; her empire was overthrown at
a blow. Buonaparte and Wellington, the two
most celebrated generals in the world, met each
other for the first time on the plains of Waterloo.
The shock was dreadful, but since then the sword
has remained in its scabbard, peace has succeeded
war, and the voice of nations has uttered a mighty
cry against kingly aggression. ‘If there still exists,’
says one, ‘a passion for lawless aggrandizement,
the grave that swallowed up the French
empire is still open, and deep enough to show the
perils of treading on its verge. The warning still
is—<i>Waterloo</i>!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now for the battle! How many men had
the Duke of Wellington? and how many had Buonaparte?
which began to fire first? and how many
soldiers were killed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Patience! patience! my account will answer
all these questions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now for it, then! now for it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I have these English now,’ said Buonaparte,
in the pride of his heart, before the battle, but his
thoughts were of a very different kind afterwards.
See! here is an account of the British and Hanoverian
army at Waterloo, as formed in divisions
and brigades on the 18th of June 1815. The
cavalry were commanded by Lieutenant-General
the Earl of Uxbridge; the 1st brigade, by Major-General
Lord Edward Somerset, K.C.B.; the
2nd by Major-General Sir William Ponsonby,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>K.C.B.; the 3rd by Major-General W. B. Domberg;
the 4th by Major-General Sir John O. Vandeleur,
K.C.B.; the 5th by Major-General Sir
Colquhoun Grant, K.C.B.; the 6th by Major-General
Sir Hussey Vivian, K.C.B., and the 7th
by Colonel Sir Frederic Arenschildt, K.C.B.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the meaning of K.C.B.? There
seems to be a great number of them that have
K.C.B. at the end of their names.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The meaning of K.C.B. is Knight Commander
of the Order of the Bath. It is a very high distinction;
and military men are very anxious to attain
it. The infantry were commanded by—the
<i>1st division</i>, Major-General G. Cooke; the <i>2nd division</i>,
Lieutenant-General Sir H. Clinton, G.C.B.;
the <i>3rd division</i>, Lieutenant-General Baron Alten;
the <i>4th division</i>, Lieutenant-General Hon. Sir
Charles Colville, K.C.B.; the <i>5th division</i>, Lieutenant-General
Sir Thomas Picton, K.C.B., and
the <i>6th division</i>, Major-General J. Lambert, Colonel
Best, and Major-General M’Kenzie. The cavalry
consisted of 8,883 men, the infantry of 29,622,
and the artillery of 5,434, total 43,939.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“More than forty-three thousand men. And
how many were there on the side of the French?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The troops that I have mentioned were English
and Hanoverian, but the whole of the army
under Wellington amounted to about 75,000 men,
and Buonaparte’s army was of somewhere about the
same force; but then, the French guards were looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>upon as equal to double their number of common
soldiers, being long accustomed to battle and conquest.
Wellington’s position was ably chosen,
with the villages of Mont St. Jean and Waterloo,
and the forest of Soignies, at his back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a deal of room the troops would take
up?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The British front was a mile broad. Skirmishing
began between the English light troops
and the French tirailleurs; Sir George Wood
firing the first gun on the advancing columns of
Jerome Buonaparte. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span> of Hougomont
was the key of the English position, and Jerome
made a desperate attack upon it. The place was
ably defended, and, first and last, not less than a
thousand English, and nearly ten thousand French
fell at Hougomont. It was awful work, but the
British bore it bravely.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, there were more French killed than there
were English.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The first attack of the French not succeeding,
they made a second: this was in the centre of the
British line. The cannon roared like thunderclaps,
and the French cuirassiers came on like a
whirlwind; but for all that they were withstood
by the British troops, who rolled back the bloody
tide of war. For a time the French occupied a
farm-house, called La Haye Sainte, but they were
dislodged with shells and cannon-balls, suffering
dreadfully. Before this took place, however, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>acted a cruel part. Five hundred German riflemen
defended La Haye Sainte until they had
no ammunition left, and the place was set on fire.
Well, when the French got possession they gave
no quarter: every man of the German rifle-corps
was bayonetted. The English troops at last won
the day. Lord Anglesey, the royal-greys, and the
Enniskilling, distinguished themselves. ‘When
will we get at them!’ cried out the Irish troops.
Brave Picton fell at the head of the ‘fighting
fifth,’ but the French were routed. Two thousand
prisoners and two eagles were taken, besides
the killed and the wounded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was no use to try to beat the English,
for the longer the French fought the worse it
was for them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not satisfied, the French made a third and
last attack. This was on the British right, and
Wellington was obliged to form his troops into
squares. The French cuirassiers were desperate,
but their attacks were fruitless. All that men
could do was done by them, but British hearts and
British hands were too strong to be conquered.
Ten thousand men on the part of Wellington, and
fifteen thousand on the side of Buonaparte, lay
dead upon the field. Marshal Ney led on the
French bravely. Never was a braver soldier.
The old French guards, the flower of the army,
dashed forward, and the carnage was dreadful.
The 27th British regiment had four hundred men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>mowed down in square, without their pulling a
trigger. The 92nd regiment routed a French
column when only two hundred strong, and the
33rd regiment was almost cut to pieces,—still
they stood their ground. Wellington looked at
his watch, longing for night, or the approach of
the Prussians. At last came the critical moment.
‘The hour is come!’ cried Wellington,
closing his telescope, and leading on the troops.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But where was Buonaparte?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When Buonaparte saw his old guard in confusion
he turned pale. ‘They are mingled together,’
said he, ‘and all for the present is lost.’
He then clapped his spurs to his horse, flying in
full gallop from the field. The fight went on,
but the French were beaten back at all points.
The Prussians came up, and Buonaparte’s army
was entirely routed. What a sight was the battle-plain!
The ball and the bullet, the sword
and the bayonet had done their work, and infantry
and cavalry, men and horses, muskets,
swords, harness, baggage, and dismounted artillery,
were mingled together; the wounded, the
dead, and the dying, lay in heaps, and in the
space of a few miles fifty thousand men and horses
bestrewed the plain. The battle had been fought,
and the victory had been won. The sun of Napoleon’s
glory had set for ever, and the glittering
diadem had fallen from his brow. Before the battle
Buonaparte was an Emperor, but Waterloo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>rolled back upon him the tide of war, crushing
his armed legions, rending his colours, trampling
on his eagles, wresting the sceptre and the baton
from his hand, tearing the epaulettes from his
shoulders, and sending him forth with a Cainlike
mark on his brow, a flying fugitive on the
face of the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The battle of Waterloo, which was won—to
say nothing of God’s goodness—by forethought,
prudence, knowledge, self-possession, confidence,
and superior tactics on the part of the commander,
and by obedience, steadiness, promptitude,
endurance, and invincible courage on the part of
the officers and men, cost England much; much
in treasure, and more in manly hearts; but it
is fair to look at both sides of the question.
It has been followed by a twenty-seven years’
peace; and if we had not endured the one, it is
uncertain if we should ever have enjoyed the
other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have told us a great deal about soldiers
and sailors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I might tell you a great deal more, boys, for
an old soldier is not soon tired in talking of his
native land, or of the bold hearts that have bled in
her service. The battle of Trafalgar, where Nelson
fell, is the most important sea-fight, and the
battle of Waterloo, which I have just described,
is the most famous engagement by land, in English
history. Many a disabled seaman from the one,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>has found an asylum in Greenwich Hospital, and
many a wounded soldier from the other has shouldered
his crutch in Chelsea College. These two
places of retreat for disabled soldiers and sailors
have been long held in high estimation. At Chelsea,
you may see the grey-headed veterans, sitting in
the sun, and at Greenwich, the weather-beaten old
tars, seated under the trees in the park, talking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>over their adventures, and fighting their battles
over again. I can fancy that I now see them
grouped together, with a flag flying over their
heads, bearing underneath the crown of Victoria
the motto, ‘Old England for ever! Soldiers and
Sailors! Wellington and Nelson! Waterloo and
Trafalgar!’</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_b_338.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“When looking on the faces and forms of the
soldiers and sailors of Chelsea and Greenwich
you would hardly regard them as the thunderbolts
of war; but age robs the eye of its fire
and the body of its strength, and habits of ease
impart an appearance of quietude altogether opposed
to the fierceness of the stormy fight; but
for all this, these are the men who have fought
England’s battles, and borne the fury of desolating
war.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, boys, I hope that I have made you
a little wiser than you were about soldiers and
sailors, without exciting in your hearts a love
of war, or setting you to sigh for a monument
in Westminster Abbey. Willingly would I take
for my motto ‘Universal peace, and every man a
brother,’ but until the time shall come when
swords shall be beaten into plough-shares, spears
into pruning-hooks, and war shall be known no
more, may red-coats deserve and receive all that
good conduct entitles them to; and blue-jackets
prefer reputation to prize-money as long as a
sail flutters in the breeze, or the Union Jack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>flies at the mast-head! May soldiers and sailors
encourage kindly feelings one towards another;
and this be their only contention, which
shall most faithfully discharge their duty, and
most truly love, serve, and honour their country.”</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
